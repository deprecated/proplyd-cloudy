	Abstract = {We present H\alpha images of an ionized nebula surrounding the M2-5Ia red supergiant (RSG) W26 in the massive star cluster Westerlund 1. The nebula consists of a circumstellar shell or ring ~0.1pc in diameter and a triangular nebula ~0.2pc from the star that in high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope images shows a complex filamentary structure. The excitation mechanism of both regions is unclear since RSGs are too cool to produce ionizing photons and we consider various possibilities. The presence of the nebula, high stellar luminosity and spectral variability suggest that W26 is a highly evolved RSG experiencing extreme levels of mass-loss. As the only known example of an ionized nebula surrounding a RSG W26 deserves further attention to improve our understanding of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Based on high quality observations of multiplet V1 of OII and the NLTE atomic computations of OII we study the density and temperature of a sample of HII regions. We find that the signature for oxygen rich clumps of high density and low temperature is absent in all objects of our sample: one extragalactic and eight Galactic HII regions. The temperatures derived from: a) recombination lines of OII, and b) recombination lines of HI together with Balmer continua are lower than those derived from forbidden lines, while the densities derived from recombination lines of OII are similar or smaller than densities derived from forbidden lines. Electron pressures derived from collisionally excited lines are about two times larger than those derived from recombination lines. These results imply that the proper abundances are those derived from recombination lines and suggest that other processes in addition to direct photoionization, such as dissipation of turbulent energy in shocks, magnetic reconnection, and shadowed regions, might be responsible for the large ADF and t2 values observed in HII regions.},

@article{2013arXiv1309.1663G,
	Abstract = {(Abridged) We present the abundance analysis of 12 PNe ionized by [WC]-type stars and wels obtained from high-resolution spectrophotometric data. Our main aims are to determine the chemical composition of the PNe and to study the behaviour of the abundance discrepancy problem (ADF) in this type of planetary nebulae. The detection of a large number of optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) from different ions were presented previously. Most of the ORLs were reported for the first time in these PNe. Ionic abundances were derived from the available CELs and ORLs, using previously determined physical conditions. Based on these two sets of ionic abundances, we derived the total chemical abundances in the nebulae using suitable ICFs (when available). In spite of the [WC] nature of the central stars, moderate ADF(O^++), in the range from 1.2 to 4, were found for all the objects. We found that when the quality of the spectra is high enough the ORLs O^++/H^+ abundance ratios obtained from different multiplets excited mainly by recombination are very similar. Possible dependence of ADFs with some nebular characteristics were analysed, finding no correlation. Abundances derived from CELs were corrected by determining the t^2 parameter. O abundances for PNe, derived from ORLs, are in general larger than the solar abundance. We derived the C/O ratio from ORLs and N/O and alpha-element/O ratios from CELs and found that these PNe are, in average, N-and C-richer than the average of large PN samples. About half of our sample is C-rich (C/O>1). The alpha-elements grow in lockstep with O abundance. Comparing the N/O and C /O ratios with those derived from stellar evolution models, we estimate that about half of our PNe have progenitors with initial masses > 4 M_sun. No correlation was found between the stellar [WC]-type and the nebular abundances.},

@article{2013MNRAS.tmp.2267Y,
	Abstract = {Using ˜1700 000 target- and sky-fibre spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have carried out a systematic search for Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) via detections of the [O III] lambdalambda4959, 5007 lines. Thanks to the excellent sensitivity of the SDSS spectroscopic surveys, this is by far the deepest search for PNe ever taken, reaching a surface brightness of the [O III] lambda5007 line down to about 29.0 mag arcsec-2. The search leads to the recovery of 13 previously known PNe in the Northern and Southern Galactic Caps. In total, 44 new PN candidates are identified, including seven candidates of multiple detections and 37 candidates of single detection. The seven candidates of multiple detections are all extremely large (between 21 and 154 arcmin) and faint, located mostly in the low Galactic latitude region and with a kinematics similar to disc stars. After checking their images in Halpha and other bands, three of them are probably H II regions, one is probably associated with a new supernova remnant, another one is possibly a true PN and the remaining two could be either PNe or supernova remnants. Based on sky positions and kinematics, seven candidates of single detection probably belong to the halo population. If confirmed, they will increase the number of known PNe in the Galactic halo significantly. All the newly identified PN candidates are very faint, with a surface brightness of the [O III] lambda5007 line between 27.0-30.0 mag arcsec-2, and very challenging to be discovered with previously employed techniques (e.g. slitless spectroscopy, narrow-band imaging), and thus may greatly increase the number of `missing' faint PNe. Our results demonstrate the power of large-scale fibre spectroscopy in hunting for ultrafaint PNe and other types of emission line nebulae. Combining the large spectral data bases provided by the SDSS and other on-going projects (e.g. the LAMOST Galactic surveys), it is possible to build a statistically meaningful sample of ultrafaint, large, evolved PNe, thus, improving the census of Galactic PNe.},

	Abstract = {Recently, Nicholls et al., inspired by in situ observations of solar system astrophysical plasmas, suggested that the electrons in H II regions are characterized by a kappa-distribution of energies rather than a simple Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Here, we have collected together new atomic data within a modified photoionization code to explore the effects of both the new atomic data and the kappa-distribution on the strong-line techniques used to determine chemical abundances in H II regions. By comparing the recombination temperatures (T rec) with the forbidden line temperatures (T FL), we conclude that kappa ~ 20. While representing only a mild deviation from equilibrium, this result is sufficient to strongly influence abundances determined using methods that depend on measurements of the electron temperature from forbidden lines. We present a number of new emission line ratio diagnostics that cleanly separate the two parameters determining the optical spectrum of H II regions---the ionization parameter q or \cal {U} and the chemical abundance, 12+log(O/H). An automated code to extract these parameters is presented. Using the homogeneous data set from van Zee et al., we find self-consistent results between all of these different diagnostics. The systematic errors between different line ratio diagnostics are much smaller than those found in the earlier strong-line work. Overall, the effect of the kappa-distribution on the strong-line abundances derived solely on the basis of theoretical models is rather small.},

Using these data to uncover new emission line candidates we have so far spectroscopically confirmed an extra 63 LMC PNe which we present here for the first time. We have also independently recovered and spectroscopically confirmed 107 of the 109 (98 per cent) PNe that were previously known to exist in the outer LMC. The majority of our newly discovered and previously known PNe were confirmed using the AAOmega, multi-object fibre spectroscopy system on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT) and the 6dF multi-object spectrograph on the UKST. These newly identified PNe were cross-checked against extant multi-wavelength imaging surveys in the near- and mid-infrared in particular and against the latest emission-line ratio diagnostic plots for improved confidence in PNe identification.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the diffuse light in the outer regions of the nearby elliptical galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster, using planetary nebulas (PNs) as tracers. The surveyed areas (0.43 squared degrees) cover M87 up to a radial distance of 150 kpc, in the ransition region between galaxy halo and intracluster light (ICL). All PNs are identified through the on-off band technique using automatic selection criteria based on the distribution of the detected sources in the colour-magnitude diagram and the properties of their point-spread function. We extract a catalogue of 688 objects down to m_5007=28.4, with an estimated residual contamination from foreground stars and background Lyalpha galaxies, which amounts to ~35% of the sample. This is one of the largest extragalactic PN samples in number of candidates, magnitude depth, and radial extent, which allows us to carry out an unprecedented photometric study of the PN population in the outer regions of M87. We find that the logarithmic density profile of the PN distribution is shallower than the surface brightness profile at large radii. This behaviour is consistent with the superposition of two components associated with the halo of M87 and with the ICL, which have different luminosity specific PN numbers, the ICL contributing three times more PNs per unit light. Because of the depth of this survey we are also able to study the shape of the PN luminosity function (PNLF) in the outer regions of M87. We find a slope for the PNLF that is steeper at fainter magnitudes than the standard analytical PNLF formula and adopt a generalised model that treats the slope as a free parameter. Comparing the PNLF of M87 and the M31 bulge, both normalised by the sampled luminosity, the M87 PNLF contains fewer bright PNs and has a steeper slope towards fainter magnitudes.},

	Abstract = {Every year, hundreds of images from telescopes on the ground and in space are released to the public, making their way into popular culture through everything from computer screens to postage stamps. These images span the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to infrared light to X-rays and gamma rays, a majority of which is undetectable to the human eye without technology. Once these data are collected, one or more specialists must process the data to create an image. Therefore, the creation of astronomical imagery involves a series of choices. How do these choices affect the comprehension of the science behind the images? What is the best way to represent data to a non-expert? Should these choices be based on aesthetics, scientific veracity, or is it possible to satisfy both? This paper reviews just one choice out of the many made by astronomical image processors: color. The choice of color is one of the most fundamental when creating an image taken with modern telescopes. We briefly explore the concept of the image as translation, particularly in the case of astronomical images from invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. After placing modern astronomical imagery and photography in general in the context of its historical beginnings, we review the standards (or lack thereof) in making the basic choice of color. We discuss the possible implications for selecting one color palette over another in the context of the appropriateness of using these images as science communication products with a specific focus on how the non-expert perceives these images and how that affects their trust in science. Finally, we share new data sets that begin to look at these issues in scholarly research and discuss the need for a more robust examination of this and other related topics in the future to better understand the implications for science communications.},

	Abstract = {The use of IFS is since recently allowing to measure the emission line fluxes of an increasingly large number of star-forming galaxies both locally and at high redshift. The main goal of this study is to review the most widely used empirical oxygen calibrations, O3N2 and N2, by using new direct abundance measurements. We pay special attention to the expected uncertainty of these calibrations as a function of the index value or abundance derived and the presence of possible systematic offsets. This is possible thanks to the analysis of the most ambitious compilation of Te-based HII regions to date. This new dataset compiles the Te-based abundances of 603 HII regions extracted from the literature but also includes new measurements from the CALIFA survey. Besides providing new and improved empirical calibrations for the gas abundance, we also present here a comparison between our revisited calibrations with a total of 3423 additional CALIFA HII complexes with abundances derived using the ONS calibration by Pilyugin et al. (2010). The combined analysis of Te-based and ONS abundances allows us to derive their most accurate calibration to date for both the O3N2 and N2 single-ratio indicators, in terms of all statistical significance, quality and coverage of the space of parameters. In particular, we infer that these indicators show shallower abundance dependencies and statistically-significant offsets compared to those of Pettini and Pagel (2004), Nagao et al. (2006) and P\'erez-Montero and Contini (2009). The O3N2 and N2 indicators can be empirically applied to derive oxygen abundances calibrations from either direct abundance determinations with random errors of 0.18 and 0.16, respectively, or from indirect ones (but based on a large amount of data) reaching an average precision of 0.08 and 0.09 dex (random) and 0.02 and 0.08 dex (systematic; compared to the direct estimations),respectively.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopy of three planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Northern Spur of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) obtained with the Double Spectrograph on the 5.1 m Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory. The samples were selected from the observations of Merrett et al. Our purpose is to investigate the formation of the substructures of M31 using PNe as a tracer of chemical abundances. The [O III] lambda4363 line is detected in the spectra of two objects, enabling temperature determinations. Ionic abundances are derived from the observed collisionally excited lines, and elemental abundances of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulfur, and argon are estimated. We study the correlations between oxygen and the alpha-element abundance ratios using our sample and the M31 disk and bulge PNe from the literature. In one of the three PNe, we observed a relatively higher oxygen abundance compared to the disk sample of M31 at similar galactocentric distances. The results of at least one of the three Northern Spur PNe might be in line with the proposed possible origin of the Northern Spur substructure of M31, i.e., the Northern Spur is connected to the Southern Stream and both substructures comprise the tidal debris of the satellite galaxies of M31.},

	Abstract = {The structure and conditions within the Helix Nebula have been determined from emission-line images in Hbeta, [O iii], and He ii and using spectra tracing a radial from the central star almost out to the northern boundary of the optical object. The nebula is approximately like a thick disk, rather than the torus suggested by low-ionization ions. The central region, previously thought to be a cavity, is filled with He^+2 with a total gas density comparable to the main ring. The electron temperature in the outer part was determined from [N ii] line ratios to be 9400 +/- 200 K, while [O iii] lines gave 11700 +/- 700 K for the bulk of the main ring of intermediate-ionization material. The Halpha/Hbeta ratio is anomalously low in the central portion, suggesting that the electron temperature there is very high. The likely source of this elevated central temperature is heating by photoelectric electrons from grains mixed in with the nebular gas, since this process depends directly on the distance from the central star and becomes relatively more important than photoionization heating at the low nebular densities that apply for the helix. However, it is unlikely that the two-phase condition that can exist when photoelectric heating dominates has produced the cometary knots that freely populate this nearby planetary nebula. Based on observations obtained at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.},

	Abstract = {We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between an ionized photoevaporation flow from a proplyd and a stellar wind from a hot star. We consider both the case of a fully supersonic wind and the case of a wind that passes through a global shock to become subsonic before reaching the proplyd. We compare the results of our simulations with the observed properties of the standoff bow shocks in the Orion proplyds, finding good agreement with the supersonic case for the closer-in proplyds. This allows the momentum flux, MV, of the stellar wind of theta1 Ori C to be constrained. More distant proplyds do not fit this model but may be explained by the subsonic case, offering the prospect of using the proplyds to probe the position of the inner shock in the wind from theta1 Ori C. Comparison of predicted silicate dust emission with published mid-infrared imaging provides evidence that submicron-sized grains are underabundant in the proplyd flows by an order of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {Stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxy formation models today. This uncertainty stems from a dearth of observational constraints as well as the great dynamic range between the small scales (<1 pc) where the feedback occurs and the large scales of galaxies (>1 kpc) that are shaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we aim to assess observationally the role of stellar feedback at the intermediate scales of HII regions. In particular, we employ multiwavelength data to examine several stellar feedback mechanisms in a sample of 32 HII regions in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively). Using optical, infrared, radio, and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells from the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation, the warm ionized gas, and the hot X-ray emitting gas. We find that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all of the sources, although two have comparable dust-processed radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The hot gas pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation pressures are 1-2 orders of magnitude below the other terms. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from the HII shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-processed radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize that similar observational work should be done on very young HII regions to test whether direct radiation pressure and hot gas can drive the dynamics at early times.},

	Abstract = {We present new 0.05" resolution (22 AU) narrowband Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera images of externally illuminated young stellar objects embedded in the Orion Nebula. We also present 0.02" resolution (9 AU) UV images of seven externally illuminated protostellar environments and the first UV spectra that cover the spectral range between 1400 and 3000 {\AA}. We discuss 43 objects for which the angular resolution has been improved over previous data by more than a factor of 2. These young stellar objects are either embedded inside the Orion Nebula and externally illuminated by the Trapezium stars or located in front of the nebula and seen in silhouette. The visibility of young stars surrounded by diffuse matter is dominated by intense line emission from ionization fronts (IFs) propagating into material photoablated from circumstellar disks by soft UV radiation. Near the Trapezium stars, the electron density at these IFs is around 10^5 to 10^6 cm^-3 and the radial intensity profiles of emission lines decrease roughly as r^-3, consistent with an approximately constant-velocity diverging flow with an r^-2 density profile. However, some radial intensity profiles are better fitted with an exponential function. Low ionization fraction near the IF and the heating and acceleration of the photoablation flow can explain deviations from the r^-3 intensity profiles. Many young stars located within 30" of theta^1 Ori C are surrounded by concentric arcs of [O iii] and Halpha emission located 0.5" to 3" from the IF facing theta^1 Ori C. These arcs may trace bow shocks formed by the interaction of the expanding photoablation flow with the fast stellar wind from theta^1 Ori C. The [O iii] emission may be enhanced by UV radiation from theta^1 Ori C, thermal conduction, and/or turbulent mixing of weakly shocked, photoablated gas with the thermalized shocked stellar wind. About 30% of the bright externally illuminated young stellar objects contain dark regions seen in silhouette against background nebular emission in Halpha and the forbidden transitions of common ions that may trace circumstellar protoplanetary disks. In some sources, the regions seen in silhouette in Halpha and ionic transitions are bright in the 6300 {\AA} [O i] line. Most externally illuminated young stellar objects have dusty tails pointing radially away from the source of ionizing photons. Tails have an average length of 500 AU, independent of the projected distance from theta^1 Ori C, are limb-brightened in emission lines, and are sometimes seen in silhouette against background nebular light, indicating that they contain large column densities of gas and dust. We discuss a variety of tail formation mechanisms and conclude that initial conditions probably play a key role in their formation. The large fraction of young stellar objects with extended circumstellar structure, the mass limits on this structure, and the estimated mass-loss rates are combined to produce an estimate for the photoionization age of the Orion Nebula. The derived photoionization age of the Orion Nebula is less than 10^5 yr and possibly as short as 10^4 yr.},

	Abstract = {We present 1.3 mm wavelength interferometric observations of externally irradiated young stellar objects (proplyds) embedded within the Orion Nebula, including the three largest circumstellar disks seen in silhouette against the background nebular light. One field is centered on the 2" diameter edge-on disk 114-426. The second field is centered on the large teardrop-shaped object 182-413 (HST 10), which contains a very opaque 0.4" diameter edge-on disk. This field also contains four other proplyds, including the large pure silhouette 183-405 (HST 16). We derive upper bounds on the dust masses of these disks from the absence of continuum emission and upper bounds on the gas masses from the lack of CO emission. These limits imply circumstellar disk masses less than 0.015 M_&sun; for the observed sources and upper bounds on the column density of ^13CO of N(^13CO) < 1.4 x 10^15 cm^-2 averaged over the synthesized beam. Comparison with lower bounds on the dust content derived from the visibility of the circumstellar material in silhouette against the background nebular light and the extinction toward the embedded central star implies that ^13CO may be less abundant in these circumstellar environments than in normal molecular clouds. The nondetection statistics are combined with estimates of radiation-induced mass-loss rates to derive an upper bound on the UV irradiation time for these young stellar objects. The young stellar objects in the Orion Nebula that are still surrounded by circumstellar material have been exposed to external UV radiation for less than 10^5 yr and possibly for as little as 10^4 yr.},

	Abstract = {New deep narrowband images of the Orion Nebula obtained with WFPC2 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and spectra taken with the HIRES spectrometer at the Keck Observatory are presented. We report eight new circumstellar disks seen in silhouette against the background nebular light and about 30 dark disks embedded within the bright proplyds rimmed by ionization fronts. Deep narrowband lambda6300 {\AA} images reveal skins of glowing [O I] emission associated with several disks embedded within bright proplyds. [O I] emission also surrounds one dark disk not surrounded by an ionization front; this object may be embedded within the photon-dominated, mostly neutral region behind the ionization front of the Orion Nebula. The intensity and morphology of the [O I] emission provides support for the photon-dominated-region models of externally irradiated circumstellar disks in which soft UV powers photoablation of the disk surface. Dozens of outflows powered by young stars have been discovered on the new images. More than 20 stellar jets emerge from the externally irradiated circumstellar disks or their associated young stars embedded within the Nebula. Most are one-sided (monopolar) subarcsecond-scale microjets, too small to be seen on ground-based images against the bright background nebular light. Additionally, wide-angle winds from 10 young stars in the outskirts of the Nebula power large-scale bow shocks facing the Trapezium OB stars. These shocks may be produced by wind-wind interactions where the T-Tauri winds interact with the outflow of plasma from the core of M42. The largest such structure, associated with the star LL Ori, contains a number of compact high-proper-motion clumps moving almost tangentially to the bow shock. The new data are combined with older HST images to determine proper motions for many nebular features. Neither the LL Ori type bow shocks in the outskirts of the nebula nor the Halpha + [O III] arcs that surround many proplyds near the Trapezium show measurable proper motions and are therefore stationary structures. However, most other bow-shaped features not centered on young stars exhibit large proper motions, with velocities ranging from 50 to 300 km s-1. The sources of many of these moving features remain unknown. The proper-motion survey of the nebular core reveals the presence of about a dozen new large-scale (>0.1 pc) outflow complexes. Many of these new outflows originate from the vicinity of the high-luminosity OMC-1S infrared and submillimeter source complex located southwest of the Trapezium. These supersonic features provide evidence that stellar outflows inject large amounts of kinetic energy into the nebula. However, a quantitative analysis indicates that their total power is small compared with the power in the plasma flowing away from the main nebular ionization front. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {Photoevaporating protoplanetary discs (proplyds) in the vicinity of hot massive stars, such as those found in Orion, are important objects of study for the fields of star formation, early disc evolution, planetary formation and H II region astrophysics. Their element abundances are largely unknown, unlike those of the main-sequence stars or the host Orion nebula. We present a spectroscopic analysis of the Orion proplyd HST 10, based on integral field observations with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES fibre array with 0.31 × 0.31 arcsec2 spatial pixels. The proplyd and its vicinity are imaged in a variety of emission lines across a 6.8 × 4.3 arcsec2 area. The reddening, electron density and temperature are mapped out from various line diagnostics. The abundances of helium, and eight heavy elements, are measured relative to hydrogen using the direct method based on the [O III] electron temperature. The abundance ratios of O/H and S/H are derived without resort to ionization correction factors. We construct dynamic photoevaporation models of HST 10 with the CLOUDY microphysics code that validate the oxygen and sulphur abundances. With the exception of [O I] lambda6300 and [S II] lambda4069, the model fit is satisfactory for all spectral lines arising from the proplyd. The models show that the classic ionization correction factor for neon significantly underestimates (0.4 dex) this element's abundance in the low ionization conditions of HST 10. Apart from iron, whose gas-phase abundance is ˜0.3 dex lower than in the local Orion nebula, most other elements in the proplyd do not show substantially different gas-phase abundances from the nebula. The abundances of carbon, oxygen and neon in HST 10 are practically the same as those in B-type stars in Orion.},

	Abstract = {We present three years of long-cadence and over one year of short-cadence photometry of the central star of the planetary nebula NGC 6826 obtained with the Kepler spacecraft, and temporally coinciding optical spectroscopy. The light curves are dominated by incoherent variability on time-scales of several hours, but contain a lower amplitude periodicity of 1.237 99 d. The temporal amplitude and shape changes of this signal are best explicable with a rotational modulation, and are not consistent with a binary interpretation. We argue that we do not observe stellar pulsations within the limitations of our data, and show that a binary central star with an orbital period less than seven days could only have escaped our detection in the case of low orbital inclination. Combining the photometric and spectroscopic evidence, we reason that the hourly variations are due to a variable stellar wind, and are global in nature. The physical cause of the wind variability of NGC 6826 and other ZZ Leporis stars is likely related to the mechanism responsible for wind variations in massive hot stars.},

Methods: We present new ISO spectra and combine them with archival IUE and optical spectra from the literature to get a complete, extinction-corrected, spectrum.

Results: The results of these two methods are compared. In addition, we discuss the star exciting the nebula.

@article{2013MNRAS.428..691H,
	Abstract = {LL Orionis-type objects (LL objects) are hyperbolic bowshocks visible around young stars in the outer Orion nebula, many of which are also associated with curved, highly collimated jets. The bowshocks are clearly due to the supersonic interaction between an outflow from the young star and an environmental flow from the core of the nebula, but the exact nature of these flows has not yet been established. We present the first high-resolution optical spectra of two of these objects, LL 1 and LL 2, together with their associated Herbig-Haro (HH) jets, HH 888 and HH 505. We combine multiple long-slit echelle spectra in the Halpha 6563 {\AA} and [N ii] 6584 {\AA} lines to produce velocity maps of the two objects at a resolution of 4text{arcsec} × 2text{arcsec} × 11 {km s^{-1}}. The gas motions within both stellar bowshocks are of rather low velocity (10-20 km s-1), but there are important differences between the two objects. LL 1 shows a high degree of symmetry, whereas LL 2 has very asymmetric kinematics that seem to follow velocity gradients in the surrounding nebula.  We also measure the line-of-sight velocity for multiple knots in the HH 888 and HH 505 jets, and combine our spectroscopy with new and existing proper-motion measurements to reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the jets. The knot motions in both jets are very similar: both flows are inclined at 40$\,^{\circ}$ to 60$\,^{\circ}$ from the plane of the sky, with exclusively redshifted knots to the north and exclusively blueshifted knots to the south. In both cases, one also sees a deceleration along the length of the jets, from >200 km s-1 close to the respective stars down to <100 km s-1 farther out. The marked contrasts that we find between the kinematics of the jets and the kinematics of the stellar bowshocks are evidence that the two phenomena are not causally related. Regular patterns in the dynamic ages of the HH 505 knots imply periodic ejections on three different time-scales: 50, 12 and 4 yr.  We use line ratios and photometry to measure electron densities and excitation/ionization conditions in the stellar bowshocks and jet knots. The LL 1 bowshock has a bright inner shell with density ~=3000 cm-3 (compared with a local nebula density of ~=1000 cm-3) and line ratios that are consistent with equilibrium photoionization models. The bowshock also has a fainter outer rim, where the line ratios show evidence of shock excitation. Many of the jet knots also show evidence for a shock contribution to their excitation and have densities from 1000 to 8000 cm-3.  Based on observations obtained at the Observatorio Astron{\'o}mico Nacional, San Pedro M{\'a}rtir, Baja California, Mexico, which is operated by the Universidad Nacional Aut{\'o}noma de M{\'e}xico. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. iraf is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science foundation. Velocities in the frame of the local standard of rest are obtained by subtracting 18.1 km s-1 from the heliocentric values. Traditionally, [O iii] is normalized by Hbeta rather than Halpha in order to minimize the effects of extinction. In our case, the extinction is known to be low (Section 6), so the main effect of using Halpha instead is to shift the y-axis by the intrinsic Balmer decrement of ˜0.5 dex.},

	Abstract = {We have performed a detailed analysis of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720) using Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 images and derived a new three-dimensional model. Existing high spectral resolution spectra played an important supplementary role in our modeling. It is shown that the Main Ring of the nebula is an ionization-bounded irregular non-symmetric disk with a central cavity and perpendicular extended lobes pointed almost toward the observer. The faint outer halos are determined to be fossil radiation, i.e., radiation from gas ionized in an earlier stage of the nebula when it was not ionization bounded. The narrowband WFC3 filters that isolate some of the emission lines are affected by broadening on their short wavelength side and all the filters were calibrated using ground-based spectra. The filter calibration results are presented in an appendix.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA Contract No. NAS 5-26555.

I believe that the workings of the cosmos are an effective way to interest the public in science due to their multidisciplinary nature and appeal. This paper is based on the idea that outreach is part of informal education and therefore must be encouraged since it is the way adults learn throughout their lives. We must take advantage of year 2009 to address astronomy in Galileo's honor. I think that outreach should be carried out in the way we enjoy learning about subjects outside our field of expertise. It must be done with passion and for the joy of giving; the gift that outreach conveys is knowledge.},

	Abstract = {In developing nations such as Mexico, basic science education has scarcely improved. There are multiple reasons for this problem; they include poor teacher training and curricula that are not challenging for students. I shall suggest ways in which astronomy can be used to improve basic education, it is so attractive that it can be employed to teach how to read and write, learn a second language, mathematics, physics, as well as geography. If third world nations do not teach science in an adequate way, they will be in serious problems when they will try to achieve a better standard of living for their population. I shall also address informal education, it is by this means that most adults learn and keep up to date with subjects that are not their specialty. If we provide good outreach programs in developing nations we can aid adult training; astronomy is ideal since it is particularly multidisciplinary. In particular radio and television programs are useful for popularization since they reach such wide audiences.},

	Abstract = {It is known that the diffuse Halpha emission outside of bright H II regions not only are very extended, but also can occur in distinct patches or filaments far from H II regions, and the line ratios of [S II] lambda6716/Halpha and [N II] lambda6583/Halpha observed far from bright H II regions are generally higher than those in the H II regions. These observations have been regarded as evidence against the dust-scattering origin of the diffuse Halpha emission (including other optical lines), and the effect of dust scattering has been neglected in studies on the diffuse Halpha emission. In this paper, we reexamine the arguments against dust scattering and find that the dust-scattering origin of the diffuse Halpha emission cannot be ruled out. As opposed to the previous contention, the expected dust-scattered Halpha halos surrounding H II regions are, in fact, in good agreement with the observed Halpha morphology. We calculate an extensive set of photoionization models by varying elemental abundances, ionizing stellar types, and clumpiness of the interstellar medium (ISM) and find that the observed line ratios of [S II]/Halpha, [N II]/Halpha, and He I lambda5876/Halpha in the diffuse ISM accord well with the dust-scattered halos around H II regions, which are photoionized by late O- and/or early B-type stars. We also demonstrate that the Halpha absorption feature in the underlying continuum from the dust-scattered starlight ("diffuse galactic light") and unresolved stars is able to substantially increase the [S II]/Halpha and [N II]/Halpha line ratios in the diffuse ISM.},

	Abstract = {We present spatially- and velocity-resolved echelle spectroscopy for NGC 7009 obtained with the UVES spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. Our objective is to analyze the kinematics of emission lines excited by recombination and collisions with electrons to determine whether similarities or differences could be useful in elucidating the well-known abundance discrepancy derived from them. We construct position-velocity maps for recombination, fluorescence, charge transfer, and collisionally-excited lines. We find a plasma component emitting in the C II, N II, O II, and Ne II recombination lines whose kinematics are discrepant: They are incompatible with the ionization structure derived from all other evidence and the kinematics derived from all of these lines are unexpectedly very similar. We find direct evidence for a recombination contribution to [N II] 5755. Once taken into account, the electron temperatures from [N II], [O III], and [Ne III] agree at a given position and velocity. The electron densities derived from [O II] and [Ar IV] are consistent with direct imaging and the distribution of hydrogen emission. The kinematics of the C II, N II, O II, and Ne II lines does not coincide with the kinematics of the [O III] and [Ne III] forbidden emission, indicating that there is an additional plasma component to the recombination emission that arises from a different volume from that giving rise to the forbidden emission from the parent ions within NGC 7009. Thus, the chemical abundances derived from either type of line are correct only for the plasma component from which they arise. Apart from [N II] 5755, we find no anomaly with the forbidden lines usually used to determine chemical abundances in ionized nebulae, so the abundances derived from them should be reliable for the medium from which they arise.},

	Abstract = {The spectra of the planetary nebula NGC 2392 is reanalysed using spectral measurements made in the mid-infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The aim is to determine the chemical composition of this object. We also make use of IUE and ground based spectra. Abundances determined from the mid-infrared lines, which are insensitive to electron temperature, are used as the basis for the determination of the composition, which are found to differ somewhat from earlier results. The abundances found, especially the low value of helium and oxygen, indicate that the central star was originally of rather low mass. Abundances of phosphorus, iron, silicon and chlorine have been determined for the first time in this nebula. The variation of electron temperature in this nebula is very clear, reaching quite high values close to the center. The temperature of the central star is discussed in the light of the observed high stages of ionization. The nebular information indicates that the spectrum of the star deviates considerably from a blackbody.  Based on  observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated  by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of  Technology.},

	Abstract = {The planetary nebula NGC 2392 possesses an extremely unusual spectrokinematic morphology, characterized by several strange and elusive structures. In this paper, extensive narrowband imaging of the source is used to investigate the shell excitation structure, while [O III] and [S II] images are ratioed to provide fully sampled mapping of electron density and temperature. As a result, we are able to confirm the presence of low densities in the various filamentary structures, an appreciable radial decrease in density in the outer shell, and finally, a probable regime of higher shell densities at the interface of the bright inner shell and lower intensity outer halo. Although temperatures are more uniform, we also find evidence for a significant temperature enhancement close to the inner-outer shell interface, and it is proposed that both anomalies (in density and temperature) arise in a postshock cooling regime. Finally, present imaging and prior spectroscopy are used to construct a revised model of the source, in which it is argued that the outer filamentary structure occupies a disklike regime, congruent with the principal plane of the outer spheroid. Individual filaments arise from low-excitation density contrasts, created through the interaction between the outer shell and a precessing jet.},

	Abstract = {NGC 2392 is a young double-shell planetary nebula (PN). Its intrinsic structure and shaping mechanism are still not fully understood. In this paper we present new spectroscopic observations of NGC 2392. The slits were placed at two different locations to obtain the spectra of the inner and outer regions. Several [Fe III] lines are clearly detected in the inner region. We infer that NGC 2392 might have an intrinsic structure similar to the bipolar nebula Mz 3, which also exhibits a number of [Fe III] lines arising from the central regions. In this scenario, the inner and outer regions of NGC 2392 correspond to the inner lobes and the outer outflows of Mz 3, respectively. We construct a three-dimensional morpho-kinematic model to examine our hypothesis. We also compare the physical conditions and chemical composition of the inner and outer regions, and discuss the implications on the formation of this type of PN.},

	Abstract = {We present results from integral field spectroscopy of a field located near the Trapezium Cluster using the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS). The observed field contains a variety of morphological structures: five externally ionized protoplanetary discs (also known as proplyds), the high-velocity jet HH 514 and a bowshock. Spatial distribution maps are obtained for different emission line fluxes, the c(Hbeta) extinction coefficient, electron densities and temperatures, ionic abundances of different ions from collisionally excited lines (CELs), C2 + and O2 + abundances from recombination lines (RLs) and the abundance discrepancy factor of O2 +, ADF(O2 +). We distinguish the three most prominent proplyds (177-341, 170-337 and 170-334) and analyse their impact on the spatial distributions of the above mentioned quantities. We find that collisional de-excitation has a major influence on the line fluxes in the proplyds. If this is not properly accounted for then physical conditions deduced from commonly used line ratios will be in error, leading to unreliable chemical abundances for these objects. We obtain the intrinsic emission of the proplyds 177-341, 170-337 and 170-334 by a direct subtraction of the background emission, though the last two present some background contamination due to their small sizes. A detailed analysis of 177-341 spectra making use of suitable density diagnostics reveals the presence of high-density gas (3.8 × 105 cm-3) in contrast to the typical values observed in the background gas of the nebula (3800 cm-3). We also explore how the background subtraction could be affected by the possible opacity of the proplyd and its effect on the derivation of physical conditions and chemical abundances of the proplyd 177-341. We construct a physical model for the proplyd 177-341 finding a good agreement between the predicted and observed line ratios. Finally, we find that the use of reliable physical conditions returns an ADF(O2 +) about zero for the intrinsic spectra of 177-341, while the background emission presents the typical ADF(O2 +) observed in the Orion nebula (0.16 $\pm$ 0.11 dex). We conclude that the presence of high-density ionized gas is severely affecting the abundances determined from CELs and, therefore, those from RLs should be considered as a better approximation to the true abundances.

	Abstract = {In an attempt to remove the systematic errors which have plagued the calibration of the H II region abundance sequence, we have theoretically modelled the extragalactic H II region sequence. We then used the theoretical spectra so generated in a double-blind experiment to recover the chemical abundances using both the classical electron temperature + ionization correction factor technique and the technique which depends on the use of strong emission lines (SELs) in the nebular spectrum to estimate the abundance of oxygen. We find a number of systematic trends, and we provide correction formulae which should remove systematic errors in the electron temperature + ionization correction factor technique. We also provide a critical evaluation of the various semi-empirical SEL techniques. Finally, we offer a scheme which should help to eliminate systematic errors in the SEL-derived chemical abundance scale for extragalactic H II regions.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of electron temperatures and metallicities in H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) has---for several decades---presented a problem: results obtained using different techniques disagree. What is worse, they disagree consistently. There have been numerous attempts to explain these discrepancies, but none has provided a satisfactory solution to the problem. In this paper, we explore the possibility that electrons in H II regions and PNe depart from a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium energy distribution. We adopt a "kappa-distribution" for the electron energies. Such distributions are widely found in solar system plasmas, where they can be directly measured. This simple assumption is able to explain the temperature and metallicity discrepancies in H II regions and PNe arising from the different measurement techniques. We find that the energy distribution does not need to depart dramatically from an equilibrium distribution. From an examination of data from H II regions and PNe, it appears that kappa >~ 10 is sufficient to encompass nearly all objects. We argue that the kappa-distribution offers an important new insight into the physics of gaseous nebulae, both in the Milky Way and elsewhere, and one that promises significantly more accurate estimates of temperature and metallicity in these regions.},

	Abstract = {Context. Analysis of published [O iii] and [S iii] temperatures measurements of emission line objects consisting of Hii galaxies, giant extragalactic Hii regions, Galactic Hii regions, and Hii regions from the Magellanic Clouds reveal that the [O iii] temperatures are higher than the corresponding values from [S iii] in most objects with gas metallicities in excess of 0.2 solar. For the coolest nebulae (the highest metallicities), the [O iii] temperature excess can reach ~3000 K.  Aims: We look for an explanation for these temperature differences and explore the parameter space of models with the aim of reproducing the observed trend of TO iii > TS iii in Hii regions with temperatures below 14 000 K.  Methods: Using standard photoionization models, we varied the ionization parameter, the hardness of the ionizing continuum, and the gas metallicities in order to characterize how models behave with respect to the observations. We introduced temperature inhomogeneities and varied their mean squared amplitude t2 . We explored the possibility of inhomogeneities in abundances by combining two models of widely different metallicity. We calculated models that consider the possibility of a non-Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution (a kappa-distribution) for the electron energies. We also considered shock heating within the photoionized nebula.  Results: Simple photoionization calculations yield nearly equal [O iii] and [S iii] temperatures in the domain of interest. Hence these models fail to reproduce the [O iii] temperature excess. Models that consider temperature inhomogeneities, as measured by the mean squared amplitude t2 , also fail in the regime where TO iii < 14 000 K. Three options remain that can reproduce the observed excess in TO iii temperatures: (1) large metallicity inhomogeneities in the nebula; a (2) kappa-distribution for the electron energies; and (3) shock waves that propagate in the photoionized plasma at velocities ~60 km s-1.  Conclusions: The observed nebular temperatures are not reproduced by varying the input parameters in the pure photoionization case nor by assuming local temperature inhomogeneities. We find that (1) metallicity inhomogeneities of the nebular gas; (2) shock waves of velocities ≲ 60 km s-1 propagating in a photoionized plasma; and (3) an electron energy distribution given by a kappa-distribution are successful in reproducing the observed excess in the [O iii] temperatures. However, shock models require proper 3D hydrodynamical simulations to become a fully developed alternative while models with metallicity inhomogeneities appear to fail in metal-poor nebulae, since they result in TrecO++ ≳ TO iii .},

	Abstract = {In this paper we develop tools for observers to use when analysing nebular spectra for temperatures and metallicities, with two goals: to present a new, simple method to calculate equilibrium electron temperatures for collisionally excited line flux ratios, using the latest atomic data; and to adapt current methods to include the effects of possible non-equilibrium '{\kappa}' electron energy distributions. Adopting recent collision strength data for [O iii], [S iii], [O ii], [S ii], and [N ii], we find that existing methods based on older atomic data seriously overestimate the electron temperatures, even when considering purely Maxwellian statistics. If {\kappa} distributions exist in H ii regions and planetary nebulae as they do in solar system plasmas, it is important to investigate the observational consequences. This paper continues our previous work on the {\kappa} distribution (Nicholls et al. 2012). We present simple formulaic methods that allow observers to (a) measure equilibrium electron temperatures and atomic abundances using the latest atomic data, and (b) to apply simple corrections to existing equilibrium analysis techniques to allow for possible non-equilibrium effects. These tools should lead to better consistency in temperature and abundance measurements, and a clearer understanding of the physics of H ii regions and planetary nebulae.},

	Abstract = {This paper, the sixth in the Semi-Empirical Analysis of Galaxies series, studies the evolution of 82302 star-forming (SF) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Star formation histories (SFHs) are derived from detailed spectral fits obtained with our publicly available spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT. Our main goals are to explore new ways to derive SFHs from the synthesis results and apply them to investigate how SFHs vary as a function of nebular metallicity (Zneb). A number of refinements over our previous work are introduced, including (1) an improved selection criterion; (2) a careful examination of systematic residuals around Hbeta (3) self-consistent determination of nebular extinctions and metallicities; (4) tests with several Zneb estimators; (5) a study of the effects of the reddening law adopted and of the relation between nebular and stellar extinctions and the interstellar component of the NaI D doublet.  Our main achievements may be summarized as follows. (1) A conventional correlation analysis is performed to study how global properties relate to Zneb, leading to the confirmation of previously known relations, such as those between Zneb and galaxy luminosity, mass, dust content, mean stellar metallicity and mean stellar age. (2) A simple formalism which compresses the results of the synthesis while at the same time yielding time-dependent star formation rates (SFR) and mass assembly histories is presented. (3) A comparison of the current SFR derived from the population synthesis with that obtained from Halpha shows that these independent estimators agree very well, with a scatter of a factor of 2. An important corollary of this finding is that we now have a way to estimate SFR in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei, where the Halpha method cannot be applied. (4) Fully time-dependent SFHs were derived for all galaxies, and then averaged over six Zneb bins spanning the entire SF wing in the diagram. (5) We find that SFHs vary systematically along the SF sequence. Though all SF galaxies formed the bulk of their stellar mass over 1 Gyr ago, low-Zneb systems evolve at a slower pace and are currently forming stars at a much higher relative rate. Galaxies at the tip of the SF wing have current specific SFRs about two orders of magnitude larger than the metal-rich galaxies at its bottom. (6) At any given time, the distribution of specific SFRs for galaxies within a Zneb bin is broad and approximately lognormal. (7) The whole study was repeated grouping galaxies within bins of stellar mass and surface mass density, both of which are more fundamental drivers of SFH. Given the existence of strong Zneb - M* - Sigma* relations, the overall picture described above remains valid. Thus, low-M* (low-Sigma*) systems are the ones which evolve slower, with current specific SFRs much larger than more massive (dense) galaxies. (8) This overall pattern of SFHs as a function of Zneb,M* or Sigma* is robust against changes in selection criteria, choice of evolutionary synthesis models for the spectral fits, and differential extinction effects.},

@article{2001MNRAS.327..141L,
	Abstract = {We present deep, high-resolution optical spectra of two Galactic bulge planetary nebulae (PN), M 1-42 and M 2-36. The spectra show very prominent and rich optical recombination lines (ORLs) from C, N, O and Ne ions. Infrared spectra from [formmu10]2.4-197mum were also obtained using the Short and Long Wavelength Spectrometer (SWS and LWS) on board ISO. The optical and infrared spectra, together with archival IUE spectra, are used to study their density and thermal characteristics and to determine elemental abundances. We determine the optical and UV extinction curve towards these two bulge PN using observed Hi and Heii recombination line fluxes and the radio free-free continuum flux density. In the optical, the reddening curve is found to be consistent with the standard Galactic extinction law, with a total to selective extinction ratio [formmu11]R≡A(V)/E(B-V)=3.1. However, the extinction in the UV is found to be much steeper, consistent with the earlier finding of Walton, Barlow & Clegg. The rich ORL spectra from C, N, O and Ne ions detected from the two nebulae have been used to determine the abundances of these elements relative to hydrogen. In all cases, the resultant ORL abundances are found to be significantly higher than the corresponding values deduced from collisionally excited lines (CELs). In M 2-36, the discrepancies are about a factor of 5 for all four elements studied. In M 1-42, the discrepancies reach a factor of about 20, the largest ever observed in a PN. M 1-42 also has the lowest Balmer jump temperature ever determined for a PN, [formmu12]Te(BJ)=3560K, 5660K lower than its [Oiii] forbidden line temperature. We compare the observed intensities of the strongest Oii ORLs from different electronic configurations, including lambda4649 from [formmu13]3s-3p, lambda4072 from [formmu14]3p-3d, lambda4089 from [formmu15]3d-4f, and lambda4590 and lambda4190 from the doubly excited [formmu16]3s'-3p' and [formmu17]3p'-3d' configurations, respectively. In all cases, in spite of the fact that the ratios of the ORL to CEL ionic abundances span a wide range from ~[formmu18]5-20, the intensity ratios of lambda4649, lambda4072, lambda4590 and lambda4190 relative to lambda4089 are found to be nearly constant, apart from some small monotonic increase of these ratios as a function of electron temperature. Over a range of Balmer jump temperature from [formmu19]3500-8100K, the variations amount to about 20 per cent for the [formmu20]3s-3p and [formmu21]3p-3d transitions and a factor of 2 for the primed transitions, and are consistent with the predictions of the current recombination theory. Our results do not support the claim by Dinerstein, Lafon & Garnett that the relative intensities of Oii ORLs vary from nebula to nebula and that the scatter is largest in objects where the discrepancies between ORL and CEL abundances are also the largest. We find that the ORL to CEL abundance ratio is highly correlated with the difference between the temperatures yielded by the [Oiii] forbidden line ratio and by the Hi Balmer jump, providing the strongest evidence so far that the two phenomena, i.e. the disparity between ORL and CEL temperature and abundance determinations, are closely related. However, temperature fluctuations of the type envisaged by Peimbert are unable to explain the low ionic abundances yielded by IR fine-structure lines. The very low Balmer jump temperature of M 1-42, coupled with its very low Balmer decrement density, may also be difficult to explain with a chemically inhomogeneous composite model of the type proposed by Liu et al. for NGC 6153.},

	Abstract = {Three decades ago, Peimbert found that in H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) Balmer jump temperatures are systematically lower than [O III] forbidden line temperatures. He suggested that because there are large temperature fluctuations in nebulae, as a consequence, heavy element abundances derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs) have been systematically underestimated. In this article, I review the recent abundance determinations for PNe using faint heavy element optical recombination lines (ORLs). For all the ionic species studied, ORLs yield higher abundances than CELs. The ratio of ORL to CEL abundances varies from object to object and correlates with the difference between the [O III] and Balmer jump temperatures. Temperature and/or density fluctuations alone are found to be insufficient to explain the very large discrepancies between the ORL and CEL abundances observed in a small number of nebulae. It is suggested that these extreme nebulae may contain metal-rich inclusions similar to those observed in ``born-again'' PN such as Abell30.},

@article{2003MNRAS.338..687T,
	Abstract = {We have obtained deep optical, long-slit spectrophotometry of the Galactic HII regions M 17, NGC 3576 and of the Magellanic Cloud HII regions 30 Doradus, LMC N11B and SMC N66, recording the optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII and OII. A spatial analysis of 30 Doradus is performed, revealing that the forbidden-line [OIII] electron temperature is remarkably constant across the nebula. The forbidden-line O2+/H+ abundance mapped by the [OIII]lambda4959 collisionally excited line (CEL) is shown to be consistently lower than the recombination-line abundance mapped by the OII V1 multiplet at 4650 {\AA}. In addition, the spatial profile of the C2+/O2+ ratio derived purely from recombination lines is presented for the first time for an extragalactic nebula. Temperature-insensitive ORL C2+/O2+ and N2+/O2+ ratios are obtained for all nebulae except SMC N66. The ORL C2+/O2+ ratios show remarkable agreement within each galactic system, while also being in agreement with the corresponding CEL ratios. The disagreement found between the ORL and CEL N2+/O2+ ratios for M 17 and NGC 3576 can be attributed to the NII V3 and V5 ORLs that were used being affected by fluorescent excitation effects.  For all five nebulae, the O2+/H+ abundance derived from multiple OII ORLs is found to be higher than the corresponding value derived from the strong [OIII]lambdalambda4959, 5007 CELs, by factors of 1.8 to 2.7 for four of the nebulae. The LMC N11B nebula exhibits a more extreme discrepancy factor for the O2+ ion, ~5. Thus, these HII regions exhibit ORL/CEL abundance discrepancy factors that are similar to those previously encountered amongst planetary nebulae.  Our optical CEL O2+/H+ abundances agree to within 20-30 per cent with published O2+/H+ abundances that have been obtained from observations of infrared fine-structure lines. Since the low excitation energies of the latter make them insensitive to variations about typical nebular temperatures, fluctuations in temperature are ruled out as the cause of the observed ORL/CEL O2+ abundance discrepancies. We present evidence that the observed OII ORLs from these HII regions originate from gas of very similar density (<3500 cm-3) to that emitting the observed heavy-element optical and infrared CELs, ruling out models that employ high-density ionized inclusions in order to explain the abundance discrepancy. We consider a scenario whereby much of the heavy-element ORL emission originates from cold (<=500 K) metal-rich ionized regions. These might constitute haloes that are being evaporated from much denser neutral cores. The origin of these metal-rich inclusions is not clear - they may have been ejected into the nebula by evolved, massive Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, although the agreement found between heavy-element ion ratios derived from ORLs with the ratios derived from CELs provides no evidence for nuclear-processed material in the ORL-emitting regions.},

@article{2003MNRAS.340..362R,
	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS long-slit spectroscopy of NGC 1976. Our goal is to measure the intrinsic line ratio [OIII] 4364/5008 and thereby evaluate the electron temperature (Te) and the fractional mean-square Te variation (t2A)across the nebula. We also measure the intrinsic line ratio [NII] 5756/6585 in order to estimate Te and t2A in the N+ region. The interpretation of the [NII] data is not as clear cut as the [OIII] data because of a higher sensitivity to knowledge of the electron density as well as a possible contribution to the [NII] 5756 emission by recombination (and cascading). We present results from binning the data along the various slits into tiles that are 0.5 arcsec square (matching the slit width). The average [OIII] temperature for our four HST/STIS slits varies from 7678 K to 8358 K; t2A varies from 0.00682 to at most 0.0176. For our preferred solution, the average [NII] temperature for each of the four slits varies from 9133 to 10232 K; t2A varies from 0.00584 to 0.0175. The measurements of Te reported here are an average along each line of sight. Therefore, despite finding remarkably low t2A, we cannot rule out significantly larger temperature fluctuations along the line of sight. The result that the average [NII]Te exceeds the average [OIII]Te confirms what has been previously found for Orion and what is expected on theoretical grounds. Observations of the proplyd P159-350 indicate: large local extinction associated; ionization stratification consistent with external ionization by theta1 Ori C; and indirectly, evidence of high electron density.},

@article{2003MNRAS.340.1136E,
	Abstract = {The study of photoionized environments is fundamental to many astrophysical problems. Up to the present most photoionization codes have numerically solved the equations of radiative transfer by making the extreme simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry. Unfortunately very few real astronomical nebulae satisfy this requirement. To remedy these shortcomings, a self-consistent, three-dimensional radiative transfer code has been developed using Monte Carlo techniques. The code, MOCASSIN, is designed to build realistic models of photoionized nebulae having arbitrary geometry and density distributions, with both the stellar and diffuse radiation fields treated self-consistently. In addition, the code is capable of treating one or more exciting stars located at non-central locations.  The gaseous region is approximated by a cuboidal Cartesian grid composed of numerous cells. The physical conditions within each grid cell are determined by solving the thermal equilibrium and ionization balance equations. This requires a knowledge of the local primary and secondary radiation fields, which are calculated self-consistently by locally simulating the individual processes of ionization and recombination. The structure and the computational methods used in the MOCASSIN code are described in this paper.  MOCASSIN has been benchmarked against established one-dimensional spherically symmetric codes for a number of standard cases, as defined by the Lexington/Meudon photoionization workshops: at Meudon in 1985 and at Lexington in 1995 and 2000. The results obtained for the benchmark cases are satisfactory and are presented in this paper. A performance analysis has also been carried out and is discussed here.},

@article{2003MNRAS.340.1153E,
	Abstract = {The three-dimensional Monte Carlo photoionization code MOCASSIN has been applied to construct a realistic model of the planetary nebula NGC 3918. Three different geometric models were tried, the first being the biconical density distribution already used some years ago by Clegg et al. In this model the nebula is approximated by a biconical structure of enhanced density, embedded in a lower-density spherical region. Spindle-like density distributions were used for the other two models (models A and B). Model A used a mass distribution slightly modified from one of Mellema's hydrodynamical models that had already been adopted by Corradi et al. for their observational analysis of NGC 3918. Our spindle-like model B instead used an analytical expression to describe the shape of the inner shell of this object as consisting of an ellipsoid embedded in a sphere.  The effects of the interaction of the diffuse fields coming from two adjacent regions of different densities were investigated. These are found to be non-negligible, even for the relatively uncomplicated case of a biconical geometry. We found that the ionization structure of low-ionization species near the boundaries is particularly affected.  It is found that all three models provided acceptable matches to the integrated nebular optical and ultraviolet spectrum. Large discrepancies were found between all of the model predictions of infrared fine-structure line fluxes and ISO SWS measurements. This was found to be largely due to an offset of ~14 arcsec from the centre of the nebula that affected all of the ISO observations of NGC 3918.  For each model, we also produced projected emission-line maps and position-velocity diagrams from synthetic long-slit spectra, which could be compared to recent HST images and ground-based long-slit echelle spectra. This comparison showed that spindle-like model B provided the best match to the observations. Although the integrated emission-line spectrum of NGC 3918 can be reproduced by all three of the three-dimensional models investigated in this work, the capability of creating projected emission-line maps and position-velocity diagrams from synthetic long-slit spectra was found to be crucial in allowing us to constrain the structure of this object.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained medium-resolution, deep optical long-slit spectra of the bulge planetary nebula (PN) M 2-24. The spectrum covers the wavelength range from 3610-7330 {\AA}. Over two hundred emission lines have been detected. The spectra show a variety of optical recombination lines (ORLs) from C, N, O and Ne ions. The diagnostic diagram shows significant density and temperature variations across the nebula. Our analysis suggests that the nebula has a dense central emission core. The nebula was thus studied by dividing it into two regions: 1) a high ionization region characterized by an electron temperature of Te=16 300 K and a density of log Ne(cm-3) = 6.3; and 2) a low ionization region represented by Te=11 400 K and log Ne(cm-3) = 3.7. A large number of ORLs from C, N, O and Ne ions have been used to determine the abundances of these elements relative to hydrogen. In general, the resultant abundances are found to be higher than the corresponding values deduced from collisionally excited lines (CELs). This bulge PN is found to have large enhancements in two alpha -elements, magnesium and neon.

	Abstract = {We present HST/STIS long-slit spectroscopy of NGC 1976. Our goal is to measure the intrinsic line flux ratio [O III] 4364/5008 and thereby evaluate the electron temperature (T[e]) and the fractional mean-square T[e] variation (t[A]^2) across the nebula. We also measure the intrinsic line flux ratio [N II] 5756/6585 in order to estimate T[e] and t[A]^2 in the N+ region. The interpretation of the [N II] data is not as clear cut as the [O III] data because of a higher sensitivity to knowledge of the electron density (N[e]). We present results from binning the data along the various slits into tiles that are 0.5'' square. The average [O III] temperature for our four HST/STIS slits varies from 7678 K to 8358 K; t[A]^2 varies from 0.00682 to 0.0176. When we use N[e] of 8000 (for slits 1 and 2) and 3000 cm-3 (for slits 4 and 5) with Lennon & Burke (1994) collision strengths, the average [N II] temperature for each of the four slits varies from 8979 K to 9761 K; t[A]^2 varies from 0.00551 to 0.0172. The measurements of T[e] reported here are an average along each line of sight. Therefore, despite finding remarkably low t[A]^2, we cannot rule out significantly larger temperature fluctuations along the line of sight. The result that the average [N II] T[e] exceeds the average [O III] T[e] confirms what has been previously found for Orion and what is expected on theoretical grounds.},

	Abstract = {We present deep optical spectrophotometry of 12 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) and three Magellanic Cloud PNe. Nine of the Galactic PNe were observed by scanning the slit of the spectrograph across the nebula, yielding relative line intensities for the entire nebula that are suitable for comparison with integrated nebular fluxes measured in other wavelength regions. In this paper we use the fluxes of collisionally excited lines (CELs) from the nebulae to derive electron densities and temperatures, and ionic abundances. We find that the nebular electron densities derived from optical CEL ratios are systematically higher than those derived from the ratios of the infrared (IR) fine-structure (FS) lines of [OIII]. The latter have lower critical densities than the typical nebular electron densities derived from optical CELs, indicating the presence of significant density variations within the nebulae, with the IR CELs being biased towards lower density regions.  We find that for several nebulae the electron temperatures obtained from [OII] and [NII] optical CELs are significantly affected by recombination excitation of one or more of the CELs. When allowance is made for recombination excitation, much better agreement is obtained with the electron temperatures obtained from optical [OIII] lines. We also compare electron temperatures obtained from the ratio of optical nebular to auroral [OIII] lines with temperatures obtained from the ratio of [OIII] optical lines to [OIII] IR FS lines. We find that when the latter are derived using electron densities based on the [OIII]52 mum/88 mum line ratio, they yield values that are significantly higher than the optical [OIII] electron temperatures. In contrast to this, [OIII] optical/IR temperatures derived using the higher electron densities obtained from optical [ClIII]lambda5517/lambda5537 ratios show much closer agreement with optical [OIII] electron temperatures, implying that the observed [OIII] optical/IR ratios are significantly weighted by densities in excess of the critical densities of both [OIII] FS lines. Consistent with this, ionic abundances derived from [OIII] and [NIII] FS lines using electron densities from optical CELs show much better agreement with abundances derived for the same ions from optical and ultraviolet CELs than do abundances derived from the FS lines using the lower electron densities obtained from the observed [OIII]52 mum/88 mum ratios. The behaviour of these electron temperatures, obtained making use of the temperature-insensitive [OIII] IR FS lines, provides no support for significant temperature fluctuations within the nebulae being responsible for derived Balmer jump electron temperatures that are lower than temperatures obtained from the much more temperature sensitive [OIII] optical lines.},

@article{2004MNRAS.351..935Z,
	Abstract = {A method is presented to derive electron temperatures and densities of planetary nebulae (PNe) simultaneously, using the observed hydrogen recombination spectrum, which includes continuum and line emission. By matching theoretical spectra to observed spectra around the Balmer jump at about 3646 {\AA}, we determine electron temperatures and densities for 48 Galactic PNe. The electron temperatures based on this method - hereafter Te(Bal) - are found to be systematically lower than those derived from [OIII] lambda4959/lambda4363 and [OIII] (88 mum + 52 mum)/lambda4959 ratios - hereafter Te([OIII]na) and Te([OIII]fn). The electron densities based on this method are found to be systematically higher than those derived from [OII] lambda3729/lambda3726, [SII] lambda6731/lambda6716, [ClIII] lambda5537/lambda5517, [ArIV] lambda4740/lambda4711 and [OIII] 88 mum/52 mum ratios. These results suggest that temperature and density fluctuations are generally present within nebulae. The comparison of Te([OIII]na) and Te(Bal) suggests that the fractional mean-square temperature variation (t2) has a representative value of 0.031. A majority of temperatures derived from the Te([OIII]fn) ratio are found to be higher than those of Te([OIII]na), which is attributed to the existence of dense clumps in nebulae - those [OIII] infrared fine-structure lines are suppressed by collisional de-excitation in the clumps. By comparing Te([OIII]fn), Te([OIII]na) and Te(Bal) and assuming a simple two-density-component model, we find that the filling factor of dense clumps has a representative value of 7 × 10-5. The discrepancies between Te([OIII]na) and Te(Bal) are found to be anticorrelated with electron densities derived from various density indicators; high-density nebulae have the smallest temperature discrepancies. This suggests that temperature discrepancy is related to nebular evolution. In addition, He/H abundances of PNe are found to be positively correlated with the difference between Te([OIII]na) and Te(Bal), suggesting that He/H abundances might have been overestimated generally because of the possible existence of H-deficient knots. Electron temperatures and densities deduced from spectra around the Paschen jump regions at 8250 {\AA}are also obtained for four PNe: NGC 7027, NGC 6153, M 1-42 and NGC 7009. Electron densities derived from spectra around the Paschen jump regions are in good agreement with the corresponding values derived from spectra around the Balmer jump, whereas temperatures deduced from the spectra around the Paschen jump are found to be lower than the corresponding values derived from spectra around the Balmer jump for all the four cases. The reason remains unclear.},

	Abstract = {In our Paper I, we presented deep optical observations of the spectra of 12 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) and three Magellanic Cloud PNe, carrying out an abundance analysis using the collisionally excited forbidden lines. Here, we analyse the relative intensities of faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) from ions of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in order to derive the abundances of these ions relative to hydrogen. The relative intensities of four high-l CII recombination lines with respect to the well-known 3d-4f lambda4267 line are found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of recombination theory, removing uncertainties about whether the high C2+ abundances derived from the lambda4267 line could be due to non-recombination enhancements of its intensity.  We define an abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) as the ratio of the abundance derived for a heavy element ion from its recombination lines to that derived for the same ion from its ultraviolet, optical or infrared collisionally excited lines (CELs). All of the PNe in our sample are found to have ADFs that exceed unity. Two of the PNe, NGC 2022 and LMC N66, have O2+ ADFs of 16 and 11, respectively, while the remaining 13 PNe have a mean O2+ ADF of 2.6, with the smallest value being 1.8.  Garnett and Dinerstein found that for a sample of about 12 PNe the magnitude of the O2+ ADF was inversely correlated with the nebular Balmer line surface brightness. We have investigated this for a larger sample of 20 PNe, finding weak correlations with decreasing surface brightness for the ADFs of O2+ and C2+. The C2+ ADFs are well correlated with the absolute radii of the nebulae, although no correlation is present for the O2+ ADFs. We also find both the C2+ and O2+ ADFs to be strongly correlated with the magnitude of the difference between the nebular [OIII] and Balmer jump electron temperatures (DeltaT), corroborating a result of Liu et al. for the O2+ ADF. DeltaT is found to be weakly correlated with decreasing nebular surface brightness and increasing absolute nebular radius.  There is no dependence of the magnitude of the ADF upon the excitation energy of the ultraviolet, optical or infrared CEL transition used, indicating that classical nebular temperature fluctuations - i.e. in a chemically homogeneous medium - are not the cause of the observed abundance discrepancies. Instead, we conclude that the main cause of the discrepancy is enhanced ORL emission from cold ionized gas located in hydrogen-deficient clumps inside the main body of the nebulae, as first postulated by Liu et al. for the high-ADF PN, NGC 6153. We have developed a new electron temperature diagnostic, based upon the relative intensities of the OII 4f-3d lambda4089 and 3p-3s lambda4649 recombination transitions. For six out of eight PNe for which both transitions are detected, we derive O2+ ORL electron temperatures of <=300 K, very much less than the O2+ forbidden-line and H+ Balmer jump temperatures derived for the same nebulae. These results provide direct observational evidence for the presence of cold plasma regions within the nebulae, consistent with gas cooled largely by infrared fine-structure transitions; at such low temperatures, recombination transition intensities will be significantly enhanced due to their inverse power-law temperature dependence, while ultraviolet and optical CELs will be significantly suppressed.},

@article{2004MNRAS.353.1251L,
	Abstract = {In Paper I, we presented spectrophotometric measurements of emission lines from the ultraviolet (UV) to the far-infrared for 12 Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) and derived nebular thermal and density structures using a variety of plasma diagnostics. The measurements and plasma diagnostic results are used in the current paper to determine elemental abundances in these nebulae. Abundance analyses are carried out using both strong collisionally excited lines (CELs) and weak optical recombination lines (ORLs) from heavy element ions.  Assuming electron temperatures and densities derived from HI recombination spectra (line and continuum), we are able to determine the ORL C abundance relative to hydrogen for all the PNe in our sample, N and O abundances for 11 of them and Ne abundances for nine of them. In all cases, ORL abundances are found to be systematically higher than the corresponding values deduced from CELs. In NGC 40, the discrepancy between the abundances derived from the two types of emission line reaches a factor of 17 for oxygen. For the other 10 PNe, the discrepancies for oxygen vary from 1.6 to 3.1. In general, collisionally excited infrared fine-structure lines, which have excitation energies less than 103 K and consequently emissivities that are insensitive to electron temperature and temperature fluctuations, yield ionic abundances comparable to those derived from optical/UV CELs. For a given nebula, the discrepancies between the ORL and CEL abundances are of similar magnitude for different elements. In other words, relative abundance ratios such as C/O, N/O and Ne/O deduced from the traditional method based on strong CELs are comparable to those yielded by ORLs, for a wide range of ORL to CEL oxygen abundance ratios, varying from near unity to over a factor of 20.  We have also determined ORL abundances relative to hydrogen for the third-row element magnesium for 11 nebulae in our sample. In strong contrast to the cases for second-row elements, Mg abundances derived from the MgII 3d-4f lambda4481 ORL are nearly constant for all the PNe analysed so far and agree within the uncertainties with the solar photospheric value.  In accordance with results from previous studies, the ORL to CEL abundance ratio is correlated with the difference between the electron temperatures derived from the [OIII] forbidden-line ratio, on the one hand, and from the hydrogen recombination Balmer discontinuity, on the other. We find that the discrepancy between the ORL and CEL abundances is correlated with nebular absolute diameter, surface brightness, the electron density derived from [SII] CELs, and excitation class. The results confirm that the dichotomy of temperatures and heavy elemental abundances determined from the two types of emission line, which has been widely observed in PNe, is a strong function of nebular evolution, as first pointed out by Garnett and Dinerstein.  Our analyses show that temperature fluctuations and/or density inhomogeneities are incapable of explaining the large discrepancies between the heavy elemental abundances and electron temperatures determined from the two types of emission line. Our analyses support the bi-abundance model of Liu et al., who have proposed that PNe contain another previously unseen component of ionized gas which, highly enriched in heavy elements, has an electron temperature of <~103 K and emits strongly in recombination lines but not in CELs. Our determinations of low average emission temperatures from the observed line intensity ratios of HeI and OII ORLs lend further support to this scenario.},

	Abstract = {We present a comparison of electron densities derived from optical forbidden line diagnostic ratios for a sample of over a hundred nebulae. We consider four density indicators, the [O II] lambda3729/lambda3726, [S II] lambda6716/lambda6731, [Cl III] lambda5517/lambda5537 and [Ar IV] lambda4711/lambda4740 doublet ratios. Except for a few H II regions for which data from the literature were used, diagnostic line ratios were derived from our own high quality spectra. For the [O II] lambda3729/lambda3726 doublet ratio, we find that our default atomic data set, consisting of transition probabilities from Zeippen (\cite{zeippen1982}) and collision strengths from Pradhan (\cite{pradhan}), fit the observations well, although at high electron densities, the [O II] doublet ratio yields densities systematically lower than those given by the [S II] lambda6716/lambda6731 doublet ratio, suggesting that the ratio of transition probabilities of the [O II] doublet, A(lambda3729)/A(lambda3726), given by Zeippen (\cite{zeippen1982}) may need to be revised upwards by approximately 6 per cent. Our analysis also shows that the more recent calculations of [O II] transition probabilities by Zeippen (\cite{zeippen1987a}) and collision strengths by McLaughlin & Bell (\cite{mclaughlin}) are inconsistent with the observations at the high and low density limits, respectively, and can therefore be ruled out. We confirm the earlier result of Copetti & Writzl (\cite{copetti2002}) that the [O II] transition probabilities calculated by Wiese et al. (\cite{wiese}) yield electron densities systematically lower than those deduced from the [S II] lambda6716/lambda6731 doublet ratio and that the discrepancy is most likely caused by errors in the transition probabilities calculated by Wiese et al. (\cite{wiese}). Using our default atomic data set for [O II], we find that Ne([O II]) ⪅ Ne([S II]) ≈ Ne([Cl III])< Ne([Ar IV]).},

	Abstract = {Electron temperatures derived from the HeI recombination line ratios, designated Te(HeI), are presented for 48 planetary nebulae (PNe). We study the effect that temperature fluctuations inside nebulae have on the Te(HeI) value. We show that a comparison between Te(HeI) and the electron temperature derived from the Balmer jump of the HI recombination spectrum, designated Te(HI), provides an opportunity to discriminate between the paradigms of a chemically homogeneous plasma with temperature and density variations, and a two-abundance nebular model with hydrogen-deficient material embedded in diffuse gas of a `normal' chemical composition (i.e. ~solar), as the possible causes of the dichotomy between the abundances that are deduced from collisionally excited lines and those deduced from recombination lines. We find that Te(HeI) values are significantly lower than Te(HI) values, with an average difference of <Te(HI) -Te(HeI)>= 4000 K. The result is consistent with the expectation of the two-abundance nebular model but is opposite to the prediction of the scenarios of temperature fluctuations and/or density inhomogeneities. From the observed difference between Te(HeI) and Te(HI), we estimate that the filling factor of hydrogen-deficient components has a typical value of 10-4. In spite of its small mass, the existence of hydrogen-deficient inclusions may potentially have a profound effect in enhancing the intensities of HeI recombination lines and thereby lead to apparently overestimated helium abundances for PNe.},

@article{2005MNRAS.362..424W,
	Abstract = {We present deep optical spectra of 23 galactic planetary nebulae, which are analysed in conjunction with archival infrared and ultraviolet spectra. We derive nebular electron temperatures based on standard collisionally excited line (CEL) diagnostics as well as the hydrogen Balmer jump and find that, as expected, the Balmer jump almost always yields a lower temperature than the [OIII] nebular-to-auroral line ratio. We also make use of the weak temperature dependence of helium and OII recombination line ratios to further investigate the temperature structure of the sample nebulae. We find that, in almost every case, the derived temperatures follow the relation , which is the relation predicted by two-component nebular models in which one component is cold and hydrogen-deficient. Te(OII) may be as low as a few hundred Kelvin, in line with the low temperatures found for the hydrogen-deficient knots of Abell 30 by Wesson, Liu and Barlow.  Elemental abundances are derived for the sample nebulae from both CELs and optical recombination lines (ORLs). ORL abundances are higher than CEL abundances in every case, by factors ranging from 1.5 to 12. Five objects with O2+ abundance discrepancy factors greater than 5 are found. DdDm 1 and Vy 2-2 are both found to have a very large abundance discrepancy factor of 11.8.  We consider the possible explanations for the observed discrepancies. From the observed differences between Te(OIII) and Te(BJ), we find that temperature fluctuations cannot resolve the abundance discrepancies in 22 of the 23 sample nebulae, implying some additional mechanism for enhancing ORL emission. In the one ambiguous case, the good agreement between abundances derived from temperature-insensitive infrared lines and temperature-sensitive optical lines also points away from temperature fluctuations being present. The observed recombination line temperatures, the large abundance discrepancies and the generally good agreement between infrared and optical CEL abundances all suggest instead the existence of a cold hydrogen-deficient component within the `normal' nebular gas. The origin of this component is as yet unknown.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a simplified formula to determine an electron temperature, Te(He I), for planetary nebulae (PNe) using the He I lambda7281/lambda6678 line flux ratio. In our previous studies of Te(He I) (Zhang et al. 2005), we used the He I line emission coefficients given by Benjamin et al. (1999). Here we examine the results of using more recent atomic data presented by Porter et al. (2005). A good agreement is shown, suggesting that the effect of uncertainties of atomic data on the resultant Te(He I) is negligible. We also present an analytical formula to derive electron temperature using the He I discontinuity at 3421{\AA}. Our analysis shows that Te(He I) values are significantly lower than electron temperatures deduced from the Balmer jump of H I recombination spectra, Te(H I),and that inferred from the collisionally excited [O III] nebular-to-auroral forbidden line flux ratio, Te([O III]). In addition, Te(H I) covers a wider range of values than either Te(He I) or Te([O III]). This supports the two-abundance nebular model with hydrogen-deficient material embedded in diffuse gas of a "normal" chemical composition (i.e. ~ solar).},

	Abstract = {Since the last IAU symposium on planetary nebulae (PNe), several deep spectroscopic surveys of the relatively faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) emitted by heavy element ions in PNe and H II regions have been completed. New diagnostic tools have been developed thanks to progress in the calculations of basic atomic data. Together, they have led to a better understanding of the physical conditions under which the various types of emission lines arise. The studies have strengthened the previous conjecture that nebulae contain another component of cold, high metallicity gas, which is too cool to excite any significant optical or UV CELs and is thus invisible via such lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe and possibly also in H II regions provides a natural solution to the long-standing problem in nebular astrophysics, i.e. the dichotomy of nebular plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations using ORLs and continua on the one hand and collisionally excited lines (CELs) on the other.},

	Abstract = {We present high-quality optical spectroscopic observations of the planetary nebula (PN) Hf2-2. The spectrum exhibits many prominent optical recombination lines (ORLs) from heavy-element ions. Analysis of the HI and HeI recombination spectrum yields an electron temperature of ~900 K, a factor of 10 lower than given by the collisionally excited [OIII] forbidden lines. The ionic abundances of heavy elements relative to hydrogen derived from ORLs are about a factor of 70 higher than those deduced from collisionally excited lines (CELs) from the same ions, the largest abundance discrepancy factor (adf) ever measured for a PN. By comparing the observed OIIlambda4089/lambda4649 ORL ratio to theoretical value as a function of electron temperature, we show that the OII ORLs arise from ionized regions with an electron temperature of only ~630 K. The current observations thus provide the strongest evidence that the nebula contains another previously unknown component of cold, high-metallicity gas, which is too cool to excite any significant optical or ultraviolet CELs and is thus invisible via such lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe provides a natural solution to the long-standing dichotomy between nebular plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations using CELs on the one hand and ORLs on the other.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We investigate temperature fluctuations in H II regions in terms of a two-phase model, which assumes that the nebular gas consists of a hot and a cold phase.   Methods: We derive general formulae for T([O III]), the [O III] forbidden line temperature, and T(H I), the hydrogen Balmer jump temperature, in terms of the temperatures of the hot and cold phases, Th and T_c.   Results: For large temperature differences, the values of t2 required to account for the observed difference between T([O III]) and T(H I) are much lower than those deduced using the classical formulae that assume random and small amplitude temperature fluctuations. One should therefore be cautious when using a two-phase model to account for empirically derived t2 values. We present a correction of a recent work by Giammanco & Beckman, who use a two-phase model to estimate the ionization rate of H II regions by cosmic rays. We show that a very small amount of cold gas is sufficient to account for t2 values typically inferred for H ii regions.},

@article{2007MNRAS.381..669W,
	Abstract = {Deep long-slit optical spectrophotometric observations are presented for 25 Galactic bulge planetary nebulae (GBPNe) and six Galactic disc planetary nebulae (GDPNe). The spectra, combined with archival ultraviolet (UV) spectra obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer and infrared spectra obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory, have been used to carry out a detailed plasma diagnostic and element abundance analysis utilizing both collisional excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines (ORLs).  Comparisons of plasma diagnostic and abundance analysis results obtained from CELs and ORLs reproduce many of the patterns previously found for GDPNe. In particular we show that the large discrepancies between electron temperatures (Te values) derived from CELs and ORLs appear to be mainly caused by abnormally low values yielded by recombination lines and/or continua. Similarly, the large discrepancies between heavy element abundances deduced from ORLs and CELs are largely caused by abnormally high values obtained from ORLs, up to tens of solar in extreme cases. It appears that whatever mechanisms are causing the ubiquitous dichotomy between CELs and ORLs, their main effects are to enhance the emission of ORLs, but hardly affect that of CELs. It seems that heavy element abundances deduced from ORLs may not reflect the bulk composition of the nebula. Rather, our analysis suggests that ORLs of heavy element ions mainly originate from a previously unseen component of plasma of Te values of just a few hundred kelvins, which is too cool to excite any optical and UV CELs.  We find that GBPNe are on the average 0.1-0.2dex more metal-rich than GDPNe but have a mean C/O ratio that is approximately 0.2dex lower. By comparing the observed relative abundances of heavy elements with recent theoretical predictions, we show that GBPNe probably evolved from a relatively metal-rich environment of initial Z ~ 0.013, compared to an initial Z <~ 0.008 for GDPNe. In addition, we find that GBPNe tend to have more massive progenitor stars than GDPNe. GBPNe are found to have an average magnesium abundance about 0.13 dex higher than GDPNe. The latter have a mean magnesium abundance almost identical to the solar value. The enhancement of magnesium in GBPNe and the large [alpha/Fe] ratios of bulge giants suggest that the primary enrichment process in the bulge was Type II supernovae. PN observations yield a Ne/O abundance ratio much higher than the solar value, suggesting that the solar neon abundance may have been underestimated by 0.2 dex.},

	Abstract = {Results from the first dedicated study of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) by means of optical integral field spectroscopy with the Very Large Telescope Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph Argus integral field unit are presented. Three typical Galactic disc PNe have been mapped with the 11.5 × 7.2-arcsec2 Argus array: 2D spectral maps of the main shell of NGC5882 and of large areas of NGC 6153 and NGC 7009 with 297 spatial pixels per target were obtained at subarcsec resolutions. A corresponding number of 297 spectra per target were obtained in the 396.4-507.8nm range. Spatially resolved maps of emission lines and of nebular physical properties such as electron temperatures, densities and ionic abundances were produced. The abundances of helium and of doubly ionized carbon and oxygen, relative to hydrogen, were derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs), while those of O2+ were also derived from the classic collisionally excited lines (CELs). The occurrence of the abundance discrepancy problem, pertaining to oxygen, was investigated by mapping the ratio of ORL/CEL abundances for O2+ [the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF)] across the face of the PNe. The ADF varies between targets and also with position within the targets, attaining values of ~40 in the case of NGC 6153 and ~30 in the case of NGC 7009. Correlations of the ADF with geometric distance from the central star and plasma surface brightness (for NGC 6153), as well as with [OIII] electron temperature, plasma ionization state and other physical properties of the targets are established. Very small values of the temperature fluctuation parameter in the plane of the sky, t2A(O2+), are found in all cases.  It is argued that these results provide further evidence for the existence in run-of-the-mill PNe of a distinct nebular component consisting of hydrogen-deficient, super-metal-rich plasma. The zones containing this posited component appear as undulations in the CII and OII ORL abundance diagnostics of about 2 spatial pixels across, and so any associated structures should have physical sizes of less than ~1000 astronomical units. Regarding the origin of the inferred zones, we propose that circumstellar discs, Abell 30-type knots, or Helix-type cometary globules may be involved. Implications for emission-line studies of nebulae are discussed.  Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme ID 075.D-0847(A).

@article{2008MNRAS.389L..33W,
	Abstract = {A thorough critical literature survey has been carried out for reliable measurements of oxygen and neon abundances of planetary nebulae (PNe) and HII regions. By contrasting the results of PNe and of HII regions, we aim to address the issues of the evolution of oxygen and neon in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in the late evolutionary phases of low- and intermediate-mass stars (LIMS), as well as the currently hotly disputed solar Ne/O abundance ratio. Through the comparisons, we find that neon abundance and Ne/O ratio increase with increasing oxygen abundance in both types of nebulae, with positive correlation coefficients larger than 0.75. The correlations suggest different enrichment mechanisms for oxygen and neon in the ISM, in the sense that the growth of neon is delayed compared to oxygen. The differences of abundances between PNe and HII regions are mainly attributed to the results of nucleosynthesis and dredge-up processes that occurred in the progenitor stars of PNe. We find that both these alpha-elements are significantly enriched at low metallicity (initial oxygen abundance <~8.0) but not at metallicity higher than the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The fact that Ne/O ratios measured in PNe are almost the same as those in HII regions, regardless of the metallicity, suggest a very similar production mechanism of neon and oxygen in intermediate-mass stars (IMS) of low initial metallicities and in more massive stars, a conjecture that requires verification by further theoretical studies. This result also strongly suggests that both the solar neon abundance and the Ne/O ratio should be revised upwards by ~0.22dex from the Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval values or by ~0.14dex from the Grevesse & Sauval values.},

	Abstract = {We have used the He I discontinuities at 3421 {\AA} to determine the electron temperatures, designated T e(He I), for a sample of five Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe). We compared T e(He I) with the electron temperatures derived from the hydrogen Balmer jump at 3646 {\AA}, designated T e(H I), and found that T e(He I) are generally lower than T e(H I). There are two possible interpretations, (1) the presence of substantial He2+ zone, or (2) the presence of hydrogen-deficient cold clumps within diffuse nebulae. A series of photoionization models were constructed to test the two scenarios. We found that the observed T e(He I)/T e(H I) discrepancies are beyond the predictions of chemically homogeneous models. Our modeling shows that the presence of a small amount of hydrogen-deficient inclusions seems to be able to reproduce the observed intensities of He I discontinuities. We stress the value of He I discontinuities in investigating nebular physical conditions. Albeit with some observational and technical limitations, He I discontinuities should be considered in future modeling work.},

	Abstract = {A significant fraction of the mature FGK stars have cool dusty disks at least an order of magnitude brighter than the solar system's outer zodiacal light. Since such dusts must be continually replenished, they are generally assumed to be the collisional fragments of residual planetesimals analogous to the Kuiper-Belt objects. At least 10% of solar-type stars also bear gas giant planets. The fraction of stars with known gas giants or detectable debris disks (or both) appears to increase with the stellar mass. Here, we examine the dynamical evolution of systems of long-period gas giant planets and residual planetesimals as their host stars evolve off the main sequence, lose mass, and form planetary nebula around remnant white dwarf cores. The orbits of distant gas giant planets and super-km-size planetesimals expand adiabatically. During the most intense asymptotic giant branch mass-loss phase, sub-meter-size particles migrate toward their host stars due to the strong hydrodynamical drag by the intense stellar wind. Along their migration paths, gas giant planets capture and sweep up sub-km-size planetesimals onto their mean-motion resonances. These planetesimals also acquire modest eccentricities which are determined by the mass of the perturbing planets, and the rate and speed of stellar mass loss. The swept-up planetesimals undergo disruptive collisions which lead to the production of grains with an extended size range. The radiation drag on these particles is ineffective against the planets' resonant barrier and they form 30-50 AU size rings which can effectively reprocess the stellar irradiation in the form of FIR continuum. We identify the recently discovered dust ring around the white dwarf WD 2226-210 at the center of the Helix nebula as a prototype of such disks and suggest such rings may be common.},

	Abstract = {Deep spectroscopy of the planetary nebula NGC 6153 shows that its heavy element abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) are 10 times higher than those derived from collisionally excited lines (CELs), and points to the existence of H-deficient inclusions embedded in the diffuse nebula. In this study, we have constructed chemically homogeneous and bi-abundance three-dimensional photoionization models, using the Monte Carlo photoionization code MOCASSIN. We attempt to reproduce the multiwaveband spectroscopic and imaging observations of NGC 6153, and investigate the nature and origin of the postulated H-deficient inclusions, as well as their impacts on the empirical nebular analyses assuming a uniform chemical composition. Our results show that chemically homogeneous models yield small electron temperature fluctuations and fail to reproduce the strengths of ORLs from C, N, O and Ne ions. In contrast, bi-abundance models incorporating a small amount of metal-rich inclusions (˜1.3 per cent of the total nebular mass) are able to match all the observations within the measurement uncertainties. The metal-rich clumps, cooled down to a very low temperature (˜800 K) by ionic infrared fine-structure lines, dominate the emission of heavy element ORLs, but contribute almost nil to the emission of most CELs. We find that the abundances of C, N, O and Ne derived empirically from CELs, assuming a uniform chemical composition, are about 30 per cent lower than the corresponding average values of the whole nebula, including the contribution from the H-deficient inclusions. Ironically, in the presence of H-deficient inclusions, the traditional standard analysis of the optical helium recombination lines, assuming a chemically homogeneous nebula, overestimates the helium abundance by 40 per cent.},

	Abstract = {Aims: In nebular astrophysics, there has been a long-standing dichotomy in plasma diagnostics between abundance determinations using the traditional method based on collisionally excited lines (CELs), on the one hand, and (optical) recombination lines/continuum, on the other. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the dichotomy. Deep spectroscopy and recombination line analysis of emission line nebulae (planetary nebulae and H ii regions) in the past decade have pointed to the existence of another previously unknown component of cold, H-deficient material as the culprit. Better constraints are needed on the physical conditions (electron temperature and density), chemical composition, mass, and spatial distribution of the postulated H-deficient inclusions in order to unravel their astrophysical origins. This requires knowledge of the relevant atomic parameters, most importantly the effective recombination coefficients of abundant heavy element ions such as C ii, O ii, N ii, and Ne ii, appropriate for the physical conditions prevailing in those cold inclusions (e.g. Te <= 1000 K).  Methods: Here we report new ab initio calculations of the effective recombination coefficients for the N ii recombination spectrum. We have taken into account the density dependence of the coefficients arising from the relative populations of the fine-structure levels of the ground term of the recombining ion (2P$\,^{\circ}$ 1/2 and 2P$\,^{\circ}$ 3/2 in the case of N iii), an elaboration that has not been attempted before for this ion, and it opens up the possibility of electron density determination via recombination line analysis. Photoionization cross-sections, bound state energies, and the oscillator strengths of N ii with n <= 11 and l <= 4 have been obtained using the close-coupling R-matrix method in the intermediate coupling scheme. Photoionization data were computed that accurately map out the near-threshold resonances and were used to derive recombination coefficients, including radiative and dielectronic recombination. Also new is including the effects of dielectronic recombination via high-n resonances lying between the 2P$\,^{\circ}$ 1/2 and 2P$\,^{\circ}$ 3/2 levels. The new calculations are valid for temperatures down to an unprecedentedly low level (approximately 100 K). The newly calculated effective recombination coefficients allow us to construct plasma diagnostics based on the measured strengths of the N ii optical recombination lines (ORLs).  Results: The derived effective recombination coefficients are fitted with analytic formulae as a function of electron temperature for different electron densities. The dependence of the emissivities of the strongest transitions of N ii on electron density and temperature is illustrated. Potential applications of the current data to electron density and temperature diagnostics for photoionized gaseous nebulae are discussed. We also present a method of determining electron temperature and density simultaneously.

	Abstract = {We present very deep CCD spectrum of the bright, medium-excitation planetary nebula NGC 7009, with a wavelength coverage from 3040 to 11 000 {\AA}. Traditional emission line identification is carried out to identify all the emission features in the spectra, based on the available laboratory atomic transition data. Since the spectra are of medium resolution, we use multi-Gaussian line profile fitting to deblend faint blended lines, most of which are optical recombination lines (ORLs) emitted by singly ionized ions of abundant second-row elements such as C, N, O and Ne. Computer-aided emission-line identification, using the code EMILI developed by Sharpee et al., is then employed to further identify all the emission lines thus obtained. In total about 1200 emission features are identified, with the faintest ones down to fluxes 10-4 of Hbeta. The flux errors for all emission lines, estimated from multi-Gaussian fitting, are presented. Plots of the whole optical spectrum, with identified emission lines labelled, are presented along with the results of multi-Gaussian fits.  Of all the properly identified emission lines, permitted lines contribute 81 per cent to the total line number. More than 200 O II permitted lines are presented, as well as many others from N II and Ne II. Due to its relatively simple atomic structure, C II presents few lines. Within the flux range 10-2-10-4 Hbeta where most permitted lines of C II, N II, O II and Ne II fall, the average flux measurement uncertainties are about 10-20 per cent. Comparison is also made of the number of emission lines identified in the current work of NGC 7009 and those of several other planetary nebulae (PNe) that have been extensively studied in the recent literature, and it shows that our line-deblending procedure increases the total line number significantly, especially for emission lines with fluxes lower than 10-3 of Hbeta. Higher resolution is still needed to obtain more reliable fluxes for those extremely faint emission lines, lines of fluxes of the order of 10-5-10-6 of Hbeta.  Plasma diagnostics using optical forbidden line ratios give an average electron temperature of 10 020 K, which agrees well with previous results of the same object. The average electron density of NGC 7009 derived from optical forbidden line ratios is 4290 cm-3. The [O III] lambda4959/lambda4363 nebular-to-auroral line ratio yields an electron temperature of 9800 K. The ratio of the nebular continuum Balmer discontinuity at 3646 {\AA}  to H II reveals an electron temperature of 6500 K, about 600 K lower than the measurements published in the literature. The Balmer decrement reveals a density of about 3000 cm-3. Also derived are electron temperatures from the He I line ratios, and a value of 5100 K from the lambda7281/lambda6678 ratio is adopted. Utilizing the effective recombination coefficients newly available, we find an electron temperature around 1000 K from the O II ORL spectrum. Thus the general pattern of electron temperatures, Te([O III]) ≳Te(H I BJ) ≳Te(He I) ≳Te(O II), which is seen in many PNe, is repeated in NGC 7009. Far-infrared fine-structure lines, with observed fluxes adopted from the literature, are also used to derive Te and Ne. The [O III] (52 + 88 mum)/lambda4959 line ratio gives an electron temperature of 9260 K, and the 52 mum/88 mum ratio yields an electron density of 1260 cm-3.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the missing compact star of Supernova 1987A (SN1987A), we analysed the cooling and heating processes of a possible compact star based on the upper limit of observational X-ray luminosity. From the cooling process, we found that a solid quark-cluster star (SQS), having a stiffer equation of state than that of a conventional liquid quark star, has a heat capacity much smaller than a neutron star. The SQS can cool down quickly, naturally explaining the non-detection of a point source in X-ray wavelengths. On the other hand, we considered the heating processes due to magnetospheric activity and possible accretion, and obtained some constraints on the parameters of a possible pulsar. Therefore, we concluded that an SQS can explain the observational limit in a confident parameter space. With a short period and a strong magnetic field (or with a long period and weak field), a pulsar would have a luminosity higher than the observational limit if the optical depth is not large enough to hide the compact star. As possible central compact objects, the parameters constrained for a pulsar can be tested for SN1987A with advanced facilities in the future.},

	Abstract = {We carry out plasma diagnostic analyses for 123 planetary nebulae (PNe) and 42 H ii regions using the N ii and O ii optical recombination lines (ORLs). New effective recombination coefficients for the N ii and O ii optical recombination spectra are used. These data were calculated under the intermediate coupling scheme for a number of electron temperature (Te) and density (Ne) cases. We use a new method to determine the Te's and Ne's for the nebular sample, combining the ORLs with the most reliable measurements for each ion and the predicted intensities that are based on the new atomic data. Uncertainties of the derived Te and Ne are estimated for each object.  The diagnostic results from heavy element ORLs show reasonable agreement with previous calculations in the literature. We compare the electron temperatures derived from the N ii and O ii ORLs, Te(ORLs), and those from the collisionally excited lines (CELs), Te(CELs), as well as the hydrogen Balmer jump, Te(H i BJ), especially for the PNe with large abundance discrepancies. Temperatures from the He i recombination lines, Te(He i), are also used for comparison if available. For all the objects included in our sample, Te(ORLs) are lower than Te(H i BJ), which are in turn systematically lower than Te(CELs). PNe with Te(He i) available show the relation Te(ORLs) <= Te(He i) <= Te(H i BJ) <= Te(CELs), which is consistent with predictions from the bi-abundance nebular model postulated by Liu et al.},

	Abstract = {In Paper I, we presented a deep, long-slit spectrum of the bright Saturn nebula NGC 7009. Numerous permitted lines emitted by the C+, N+, O+ and Ne+ ions were detected. Gaussian profile fitting to the spectrum yielded more than 1000 lines, the majority of which are optical recombination lines (ORLs) of heavy-element ions. In the current paper, we present a critical analysis of the rich optical recombination spectrum of NGC 7009, in the context of the bi-abundance nebular model proposed by Liu et al. Transitions from individual multiplets are checked carefully for potential blended lines. The observed relative intensities are compared with the theoretical predictions based on high-quality effective recombination coefficients, now available for the recombination line spectrum of a number of heavy-element ions.  The possibility of plasma diagnostics using the ORLs of various heavy-element ions is discussed in detail. The line ratios that can be used to determine electron temperature are presented for each ion, although there is still a lack of adequate atomic data and some of the lines are still not detected in the spectrum of NGC 7009 due to weakness and/or line blending. Plasma diagnostics based on the N II and O II recombination spectra both yield electron temperatures close to 1000 K, which is lower than those derived from the collisionally excited line (CEL) ratios (e.g. the [O III] and [N II] nebular-to-auroral line ratios; see Paper I for details) by nearly one order of magnitude. The very low temperatures yielded by the O II and N II ORLs indicate that they originate from very cold regions. The C2+/H+, N2+/H+, O2+/H+ and Ne2+/H+ ionic abundance ratios derived from ORLs are consistently higher, by about a factor of 5, than the corresponding values derived from CELs. In calculating the ORL ionic abundance ratios, we have used the newly available high-quality effective recombination coefficients, and adopted an electron temperature of ˜1000 K, as given by the ORL diagnostics and as a consequence presumably representing the physical conditions prevailing in the regions where the heavy-element ORLs arise. Measurements of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) CELs from the literature are used to calculate CEL ionic abundance ratios when optical data are not available for the ionic species. A comparison of results of plasma diagnostics and abundance determinations for NGC 7009 points to the existence of `cold', metal-rich (i.e. H-deficient) inclusions embedded in the hot, diffuse ionized gas, first postulated by Liu et al.  At electron temperatures yielded by the N II and O II ORLs, the predicted relative intensities of ORLs agree well with the observed values, indicating that the current quantum calculations of the recombination spectra of those two ionic species well represent the recombination processes under nebular conditions. Deviations from the LS coupling, noticed in an earlier quantitative spectroscopy by Liu et al. for the same object, are again confirmed, especially for recombination lines of the 4f-3d transition array. For N II, as well as for O II, the ionic abundances derived from different J-resolved transitions within a multiplet, or from the transitions belonging to different multiplets, agree with each other. This is another evidence that the new effective recombination coefficients are reliable. New calculations of the effective recombination coefficients for the Ne II lines at nebular temperatures and densities are needed.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained deep spectra of 26 planetary nebulae (PNe) and 9 compact H ii regions in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 300, and analyzed them together with those of the giant H ii regions previously observed. We have determined the physical properties of all these objects and their He, N, O, Ne, S and Ar abundances in a consistent way. We find that, globally, compact H ii regions have abundance ratios similar to those of giant H ii regions, while PNe have systematically larger N/O ratios and similar Ne/O and Ar/O ratios. We demonstrate that the nitrogen enhancement in PNe cannot be only due to second dredge-up in the progenitor stars, since their initial masses are around 2-2.5 M&sun;. An extra mixing process is required, perhaps driven by stellar rotation. Concerning the radial abundance distribution, PNe behave differently from H ii regions: in the central part of the galaxy their average O/H abundance ratio is 0.15 dex smaller. Their abundance dispersion at any galactocentric radius is significantly larger than that shown by H ii regions and many of them have O/H values higher than H ii regions at the same galactocentric distance. This suggests that not only nitrogen, but also oxygen is affected by nucleosynthesis in the PN progenitors, by an amount which depends at least on the stellar rotation velocity and possibly other parameters. The formal O/H, Ne/H and Ar/He abundance gradients from PNe are significantly shallower than those from H ii regions. We argue that this indicates a steepening of the metallicity gradient in NGC 300 during the last Gyr, rather than an effect of radial stellar motions, although the large observed dispersion makes this conclusion only tentative.

	Abstract = {We revisit the question of the ionization of the diffuse medium in late-type galaxies, by studying NGC 891, the prototype of edge-on spiral galaxies. The most important challenge for the models considered so far was the observed increase of [O III]/Hbeta, [O II]/Hbeta and [N II]/Halpha with increasing distance to the galactic plane. We propose a scenario based on the expected population of massive OB stars and hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) in this galaxy to explain this observational fact. In the framework of this scenario we construct a finely meshed grid of photoionization models. For each value of the galactic altitude z we look for the models which simultaneously fit the observed values of the [O III]/Hbeta, [O II]/Hbeta and [N II]/Halpha ratios. For each value of z we find a range of solutions which depends on the value of the oxygen abundance. The models which fit the observations indicate a systematic decrease of the electron density with increasing z. They become dominated by the HOLMES with increasing z only when restricting to solar oxygen abundance models, which argues that the metallicity above the galactic plane should be close to solar. They also indicate that N/O increases with increasing z.},

	Abstract = {In an effort to explain the ionization of gas in elliptical galaxies, we have computed the Lyman continuum output from an ageing starburst, using isochrone synthesis spectral evolution techniques. We have shown that post-AGB stars provide sufficient ionizing radiation to account for the observed H-alpha luminosity and equivalent width in very early type galaxies. Photoionization models using the radiation field from these stars are shown to easily reproduce the excitation level of the ionized gas. Thus, we argue that the ionization observed in normal elliptical galaxies is provided by their old stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {We compare calculated intensities of lines of C II, N I, N II, O I and O II with a published deep spectroscopic survey of IC 418. Our calculations use a self-consistent nebular model and a synthetic spectrum of the central star atmosphere to take into account line excitation by continuum fluorescence and electron recombination. We found that the N II spectrum of the s, p and most d states is excited by fluorescence due to the low-excitation conditions of the nebula. Many C II and O II lines have significant amount of excitation by fluorescence. Recombination excites all the lines from the f and g states and most O II lines. In the neutral-ionized boundary, the N I quartet and O I triplet dipole-allowed lines are excited by fluorescence, while the quintet O I lines are excited by recombination. Electron excitation produces the forbidden optical lines of O I, and continuum fluorescence enhances the N I forbidden line intensities. Lines excited by fluorescence of light below the Lyman limit thus suggest a new diagnostic to explore the inner boundary of the photodissociation region of the nebula.},

	Abstract = {Photoelectric spectrophotometry of emission lines in the 3700-7400-A range is presented for the Eta Carinae nebula, NGC 2359, and NGC 2467. From these observations the chemical abundances of He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Cl relative to hydrogen are derived. These abundances are used, together with those of the Orion Nebula and M8, to obtain abundance gradients across the disk of the Galaxy. The sample covers a galactocentric radial range of about 6 kpc. The values for the oxygen and nitrogen gradients evaluated at the solar distance are d log(O/H)/dR equals -0.13 plus or minus 0.04 per kpc and d log(N/H)/dR equals -0.23 plus or minus 0.06 per kpc. The oxygen gradient is steeper than that derived from planetary nebulae and steeper than the metallicity gradient derived from intermediate-age stars. The nitrogen gradient is similar to that derived from planetary nebulae. The values of the enrichment of helium and nitrogen relative to oxygen are compared with those derived from planetary nebulae and extragalactic H II regions.},

The four types of planetary nebulas in the order of decreasing heavy element abundances are (1) He and N rich, (2) intermediate population, (3) high velocity, and (4) halo population. The second type is associated with well defined He, N, and O gradients across the galactic disk, and the oxygen gradient is similar to the metallicity gradient derived from GK giants and F main sequence stars.

@article{1998AJ....115..263O,
	Abstract = {HST Planetary Camera images have been used to quantitatively determine key parameters characterizing emission-line proplyds in the Orion Nebula. A previous conclusion that the objects are radiation-bounded ionization fronts is confirmed and found to be in excellent agreement with the observations. Only a very loose correlation of proplyd size with distance from the ionizing star 1 Ori C was found. The brightness distribution around the bright cusp facing 1 Ori C is found to not be in agreement with simple spherical models. The brightness distribution along radial lines passing through the center of the proplyds was subjected to careful analysis, including the finite resolution of the camera. It was found that the proplyd atmospheres are more compact than the r exp -3 relation expected for a freely expanding gas; rather, the best fit is to a surface brightness decreasing exponentially with a scale height of 7 x 10 exp 14 cm. This observation argues that the proplyds are not rapidly losing material and hence may not be short-lived objects, a conclusion also reached through consideration of their frequency and location. This also requires a constraining force that is isotropic, since the scale height does not depend upon the orientation with respect to 1 Ori C. Arguments are presented that this constraining force is provided by radiation pressure of nebular Ly photons acting upon the dust mixed with the proplyd gas.},

	Abstract = {We present Halpha images of five edge-on galaxies: NGC 891, NGC 4631, NGC 4244, NGC 3003, and UGC 9242. We also analyze [S II] lambdalambda6717, 6731 and [O III] lambda5007 images of NGC 4631. For several of these galaxies, these images are the most sensitive to date. We analyze the ionized gas content, with particular attention to the diffuse ionized gas (DIG). The DIG layer in NGC 891 is traced out to at least 5 kpc from the midplane, confirming an earlier spectroscopic detection. The DIG in four of these galaxies contributes 40%-50% of the total Halpha luminosity, similar to the contribution in face-on galaxies, but in NGC 891 the DIG contributes 80%-90%. This is likely due to the higher dust content in the disk of NGC 891, which obscures the H II regions but may also reflect the extraordinary prominence of the DIG layer in that galaxy. Our very deep image of UGC 9242 shows very low surface brightness emission, as low as 0.3 pc cm^-6, reaching 4-5 kpc above the midplane. This galaxy also exhibits filaments near the bright Halpha nucleus, an indication of a starburst superwind. In NGC 4631 we see a very large shell of emission extending 3.5 kpc into the halo. The [S II]/Halpha and [O III]/Halpha ratios in NGC 4631 are consistent with the ratios seen in other galaxies, and with photoionization models. There is a region on the southeast side of disk where the [O III]/(Halpha+[N II]) ratio reaches over 1.0 in the DIG, which coincides with an H I supershell. We use our very deep images of NGC 3003 and UGC 9242 to search for ionized gas in the outer disks as a test of the strength of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. We find no outer disk emission down to our 1 sigma limit of 0.13 pc cm^-6 on scales of 1.5 kpc in NGC 3003. Based on this limit we rule out a metagalactic ionizing radiation field stronger than 11x10^-23 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 Hz^-1 sr^-1. There is an indication of extended disk emission in UGC 9242, which would imply a stronger radiation field, but various concerns, most importantly flat-fielding uncertainties due to foreground stars in the image, lead us to question whether this feature is real.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in three Sculptor group galaxies: NGC 55, NGC 253, and NGC 300. The study is based on narrow band imagery in Halpha + [N II](6548+6583 A) and [S II] (6717+6731 A). We find that DIG contributes 33 to 58% of the total Halpha luminosity in these galaxies, or 30 to 54% after correcting for scattered light. We find that NGC 300 has a higher fractional DIG luminosity than the other galaxies in our sample, but it is not clear whether this is a significant difference or an effect of the high inclination of the other galaxies. The diffuse emission, averaged over the optical extent of the disk, has a face-on emission measure of 5 to 10 pc cm^-6^. The DIG is concentrated near H II regions, although significant emission is seen at large distances from H II regions, up to 0.5 to 1 kpc. The [S II]/(Halpha +[N II]) ratio is enhanced in the DIG, typically around 0.3 to 0.5, compared to 0.2 for the H II regions in these galaxies. These properties are similar to those measured for the DIG in the Milky Way and in other nearby spirals. The line ratios, large- scale distribution, and energy requirement suggest that photoionization is the dominant ionization mechanism.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a spectroscopic investigation of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in M33, M81, and M51. All three galaxies have enhanced [S II]/Halpha and [N II]/Halpha ratios in the DIG compared to H II regions, in agreement with the predictions of photoionization models. The DIG in all three galaxies also has [O III]/Hbeta ratios equal to or greater than that in neighboring H II regions. The [S II]/[N II] ratio does not vary with Halpha surface brightness and is similar in both H II regions and DIG. We have tentatively detected the He I lambda5876 line in the bright DIG near NGC 604, indicating a contribution from O7 and hotter stars to the ionizing spectrum in the DIG at that location. The DIG in M33 has lower [N II]/Halpha ratios than M51 or the Galaxy, most likely because of low N abundance in M33. We used CLOUDY models to test the feasibility of two photoionization sources for the DIG: (1) the diluted ionizing continua of massive stars (``standard'' models) and (2) the transmitted ionizing continua of density-bounded H II regions (``leaky H II region'' models). The leaky H II region models produce higher [S II]/Halpha, [N II]/Halpha, and [O III]/Hbeta ratios than standard DIG models for the same stellar temperatures. This alleviates somewhat the problem of producing high [O III]/Hbeta ratios in the DIG. However, no single model can simultaneously reproduce all three line ratios. We conclude that either a combination of models is necessary or other ionization or heating mechanisms play a role in powering the DIG. Finally, we report on the spectrum of ionized gas associated with the companion to M51, NGC 5195. The gas in and around NGC 5195 has very high forbidden-line ratios and broad line widths (~ 500 km s-1 FWHM), indicative of shock-ionized gas. At some locations the emission lines split into two velocity components, suggesting an expanding structure or outflow. The line ratios, morphology, and kinematics show that the interstellar medium in NGC 5195 is very disturbed.  Based on observations obtained with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.},

	Abstract = {Images and long-slit echelle spectra of the Halpha emission from 14 dwarf galaxies and M82 have been used to identify expanding shells of ionized gas. Supershells (radius >300 pc) are found in 12 of the dwarfs. The measured shell sizes and expansion speeds constrain the ages and power requirements of the bubbles. The dynamical age of the larger bubbles is typically about 10 Myr, and ionized shells older than 20 Myr are rare. An energy equivalent to 100-10,000 supernova explosions over this period is needed to drive the shock front that sweeps out the cavity. The current star formation rates are high enough to meet these power requirements. Many of the shells will break through the surrounding layer of H I supersonically, but the projected expansion speeds are typically less than the lower limits on the escape velocity. Some of the shell material may permanently escape from a few galaxies such as NGC 1569. Whether bound to the galaxy or not, these outflows probably play an important role in regulating the star formation rate and are expected to significantly influence the chemical evolution of the galaxies. The shells lift gas out of the disk at rates comparable to, or even greater than, the current galactic star formation rates. They will displace a substantial fraction of the interstellar gas only if their duty cycle is much longer than the rotational period of the disk.},

	Abstract = {We present long-slit optical spectroscopy of three high surface brightness Magellanic irregular galaxies. This paper draws attention to our detection of He I lambda 5876 line emission from the ionized gas outside the H II regions or the warm ionized phase of the interstellar medium. We measure a mean reddening-corrected intensity ratio of He I lambda 5876/H alpha ~ 0.041 independent of spatial location. This ratio is much higher than that measured in the diffuse, warm ionized interstellar medium of the Milky Way (Reynolds & Tufte). The high value of He I lambda 5876/H alpha implies the helium ionization fraction is approximately equal to the hydrogen ionization fraction in the diffuse ionized gas (DIG). If the DIG is powered by young stars, then stars hotter than 40,000 K must contribute to the Lyman-continuum radiation reaching the DIG. Since optical and ultraviolet spectra confirm the presence of such massive stars in these galaxies, stellar photoionization remains the most likely power source. The contrast with the low helium ionization in the Galactic DIG, however, is intriguing and provides strong evidence that the physical state of the DIG, not just its presence, varies among galaxies.},

@article{1997ApJ...491..561M,
	Abstract = {I present measurements of optical emission-line ratios from long-slit spectra of 14 star-forming dwarf galaxies. All members of the sample have a prominent component of diffuse warm ionized gas (DIG). Spectra of the DIG are characterized by high [O I]/H alpha intensity ratios in addition to high [O II]/[O III], [S II]/H alpha , [N II]/H alpha , and low [O III]/H beta ratios relative to the H II regions. Measurements from ~350 spectra extracted at spatial intervals of ~20-150 pc show that this spectral change is gradual and continuous; hence, the boundary between H II regions and DIG is not well defined spectroscopically. In diagnostic line-ratio diagrams, the spectral transition advances along a narrow track that is distinctly different from the well-established H II region excitation sequence. The line ratios progress toward the region populated by weak-[O I] Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-Line Regions. I show that this H II-DIG transition sequence is driven primarily by a decrease in the relative density of ionizing photons to atoms, i.e., the ionization parameter. The radial gradient in the ionization parameter is consistent with the dilution of radiation from a centralized source. This result suggests that the dominant excitation mechanism of the DIG is photoionization by massive stars associated with the main star-forming regions. In several of the galaxies, however, an additional excitation mechanism is required to explain the moderately high [O III]/H beta at very high [S II]/H alpha and the sharp increase in [O I]/H alpha with only a moderate increase in [O II]/[O III]. I show that these line ratios can be explained by a contribution to the emission from shock-excited gas. The inferred shock speeds are between 60 km s-1 and 100 km s-1; the line ratios in the regions with the lowest surface brightness require the largest relative contribution from shocks, up to 30%-50% of the emission. The prevalence of a secondary emission component from shocked gas is difficult to quantify. Where the metallicity is very low and/or the shock speed is <~60 km s-1, the line ratios alone cannot distinguish emission from shocked gas from that from dilute H II regions. Among the galaxies, differences in the DIG line ratios can be largely attributed to the galactic metallicity. At similar metallicity, however, spectral differences are related to the ionization parameter and ionization state of the parent H II regions. This result provides direct evidence that star formation affects the structure of the interstellar medium on a global scale. I find that much of the observed variation in H II region ionization parameters is caused by substantial differences in their filling factors of warm ionized clouds. Based on these results, I suggest that the DIG spectra reflect the porosity of the star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {We present results from integral field spectroscopy with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrograph at the 3.5-m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory of the intense star-forming region [HL90] 111 at the centre of the starburst galaxy IC 10. We have obtained maps with a spatial sampling of 1 √{\'o} 1 arcsec2= 3.9√{\'o} 3.9 pc2 of different emission lines and analysed the extinction, physical conditions, nature of the ionization and chemical abundances of the ionized gas, as well determined locally the age of the most recent star formation event. By defining several apertures, we study the main integrated properties of some regions within [HL90] 111. Two contiguous spaxels show an unambiguous detection of the broad He IIlambda4686 emission line, this feature seems to be produced by a single late-type WN star. We also report a probable N and He enrichment in the precise spaxels where the Wolf-Rayet (WR) features are detected. The enrichment pattern is roughly consistent with that expected for the pollution of the ejecta of a single or a very small number of WR stars. Furthermore, this chemical pollution is very localized ({\`A}{\'u}2 arcsec {\`A}{\'u}7.8 pc) and it should be difficult to detect in star-forming galaxies beyond the Local Volume. We also discuss the use of the most common empirical calibrations to estimate the oxygen abundances of the ionized gas in nearby galaxies from 2D spectroscopic data. The ionization degree of the gas plays an important role when applying these empirical methods, as they tend to give lower oxygen abundances with increasing ionization degree.

	Abstract = {We present results from integral field spectroscopy with the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrograph of the head of the Herbig-Haro (HH) object HH202 with a spatial sampling of 1 √{\'o} 1arcsec2. We have obtained maps of different emission lines, physical conditions - such as electron temperature and density - and ionic abundances from recombination and collisionally excited lines. We present the first map of the Balmer temperature and of the temperature fluctuation parameter, t2. We have calculated the t2 in the plane of the sky, which is substantially smaller than that determined along the line of sight. We have mapped the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) of O2+, ADF(O2+), finding its maximum value at the HH202-S position. We have explored the relations between the ADF(O2+) and the electron density, the Balmer and [OIII] temperatures, the ionization degree as well as the t2 parameter. We do not find clear correlations between these properties and the results seem to support that the ADF and t2 are independent phenomena. We have found a weak negative correlation between the O2+ abundance determined from recombination lines and the temperature, which is the expected behaviour in an ionized nebula, hence it seems that there is no evidence for the presence of supermetal-rich droplets in HII regions.

	Abstract = {We present results of deep echelle spectrophotometry of the brightest knot of the Herbig-Haro object HH 202 in the Orion Nebula - HH 202-S - using the Ultraviolet Visual Echelle Spectrograph in the spectral range from 3100 to 10400 √{\"O}. The high spectral resolution of the observations has permitted to separate the component associated with the ambient gas from that associated with the gas flow. We derive electron densities and temperatures from different diagnostics for both components, as well as the chemical abundances of several ions and elements from collisionally excited lines, including the first determinations of Ca+ and Cr+ abundances in the Orion Nebula. We also calculate the He+, C2+, O+ and O2+ abundances from recombination lines. The difference between the O2+ abundances determined from collisionally excited and recombination lines - the so-called abundance discrepancy factor - is 0.35 and 0.11 dex for the shock and nebular components, respectively. Assuming that the abundance discrepancy is produced by spatial variations in the electron temperature, we derive values of the temperature fluctuation parameter, t2, of 0.050 and 0.016 for the shock and nebular components, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain almost coincident t2 values for both components from the analysis of the intensity ratios of HeI lines. We find significant departures from case B predictions in the Balmer and Paschen flux ratios of lines of high principal quantum number n. We analyse the ionization structure of HH 202-S, finding enough evidence to conclude that the flow of HH 202-S has compressed the ambient gas inside the nebula trapping the ionization front. We measure a strong increase of the total abundances of nickel and iron in the shock component, the abundance pattern and the results of photoionization models for both components are consistent with the partial destruction of dust after the passage of the shock wave in HH 202-S.

@article{1997ApJ...491..114W,
	Abstract = {We report the initial results from a program to study the morphology, physical state, and kinematics of the "diffuse ionized medium" (DIM) in a sample of the nearest and brightest late-type galaxies. For each of five galaxies (NGC 2403, M81, NGC 4395, M51, and M101), we have analyzed deep narrowband H alpha images of the entire star-forming disk and long-slit spectra of the inner (~10 kpc) disk with a resolution of 40-75 km s-1. We find that the DIM covers most of the star-forming disk and is morphologically related to the presence of high surface brightness gas (the giant H II regions). The DIM and the giant H II regions differ systematically in their physical and dynamical state. The DIM is characterized by enhanced emission in the low-ionization forbidden lines ([O I], [N II], and [S II]), and even the high-ionization [O III] lambda 5007 line is moderately strong in the DIM in at least three cases. This last result contrasts with upper limits on the [O III] surface brightness in the local DIM of our own Galaxy (the "Reynolds Layer"). We directly verify the inference made by Lehnert and Heckman that the DIM contributes significantly to the spatially integrated (global) emission-line ratios measured in late-type galaxies. We also find that the DIM is more disturbed kinematically than the gas in the giant H II regions. The deconvolved (intrinsic) widths of the H alpha and [N II] lambda 6584 lines range from 30 to 100 km s-1 (FWHM) in the DIM compared to 20-50 km s-1 in the giant H II regions. The high-ionization gas in the DIM is more kinematically disturbed than the low-ionization gas: the [O III] lambda 5007 lines have intrinsic widths of 70-150 km s-1. The differing kinematics implies that the DIM is not a single monolithic phase of the ISM. Instead, it may consist of a "quiescent" DIM with a low ionization state and small scale height (few hundred parsec) and a "disturbed" DIM with a high ionization state and moderate scale height (0.5-1 kpc). We argue that the quiescent DIM is most likely photoionized by radiation from O stars leaking out of giant H II regions (although this requires fine-tuning the opacity of galactic disks to ionizing radiation). The disturbed DIM is most likely heated by the mechanical energy supplied by supernovae and stellar winds. Since the disturbed DIM accounts for only a minority (<20%) of the H alpha emission in the regions we have studied, there is no fundamental energetics problem with this model, but it does require mechanically heated gas to have a high areal covering factor in the inner disk (which needs to be confirmed observationally). We find no clear discontinuity between the physical and dynamical properties of the giant H II regions and the quiescent DIM. The quiescent DIM is morphologically related to the giant H II regions and there is a smooth dependence of the emission-line ratios and emission-line widths on the surface brightness of the emission. Thus, we suggest that a unified approach to the study of the DIM and giant H II regions in star-forming galaxies will prove fruitful.},

@article{1996ApJ...462..712R,
	Abstract = {We present deep images of nine nearby edge-on galaxies in the Halpha line, with the goal of understanding the frequency of occurrence and physical properties of extraplanar (above the H II region layer) diffuse ionized gas (DIG). None of the nine galaxies shows an extraplanar layer as bright or as widespread as those of NGC 891 or NGC 5775. Most galaxies show only a few patches or a few filaments of extraplanar gas. Others show no detectable extraplanar gas at all. Modeling of the most edge-on galaxies shows that vertical columns of emission measure for these patches (2-9 pc cm^-6^) are comparable to those of the local Reynolds layer, although there are uncertainties such as the extent of the emission region along the line of sight. It is therefore probably the case that the typical spiral galaxy has extraplanar DIG in only a few isolated regions, presumably above sites of active star formation, and perhaps concentrated to spiral arms. Considering these and previously observed galaxies, a clear correlation has emerged that the galaxies with the highest star formation rates or star formation rates per unit area generally have the most widespread and brightest extraplanar Halpha emission. This is in agreement with the known relationship between extraplanar Halpha brightness and disk star formation along the major axis of NGC 891. The most prominent layer of extraplanar DIG is in NGC 4302, where emission is detectable out to a galactocentric radius of 4 kpc and a height of 2 kpc. The best studied galaxy in the sample, NGC 5907, shows no evidence for extraplanar DIG. However, it is inclined such that two- dimensional structure can be seen in the H II region distribution, which makes extraplanar gas difficult to detect. Nevertheless, a widespread layer like that of NGC 891 is unlikely to be present, but one associated with spiral arms and covering only a small fraction of the disk (as seems to be the case for M31) cannot be ruled out. Another interesting discovery is of a filamentary system above and below the center of NGC 4013. The filaments form an H shape centered on the nucleus and resemble a much larger system of filaments in NGC 3079. They are presumably gas swept up by a wind from a nuclear starburst. Two other galaxies also show loops or filaments above the nucleus, which suggests that, if they trace nuclear starbursts, such events are occurring in a nonnegligible fraction of normal spirals.},

@article{1997ApJ...474..129R,
	Abstract = {A deep long-slit spectrum of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891 has been obtained. The slit crosses the plane at a galactocentric radius of 5 kpc and covers DIG on both the east and west sides of the galaxy. The primary motivation was to attempt to detect the recombination line He I lambda 5876, the strength of which relative to H alpha provides a direct constraint on the hardness of the ionizing spectrum. In the DIG of the Milky Way, this line ratio has turned out to be surprisingly low (Reynolds & Tufte; Heiles et al.), implying an ionizing spectrum much softer than had been inferred from the more readily observable forbidden lines, such as [N II] lambda 6583 and [S II] lambda 6717. The He I line has been detected in NGC 891 to a height of about 1.5 kpc from the plane---well into the diffuse gas layer. In the DIG, He I/H alpha ~ 0.034, implying that helium is about 70% ionized and that the ionizing spectrum is significantly harder than in the Reynolds layer. The spectrum also allows very detailed mapping of the [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha ratio as a function of height off the plane. This ratio reaches peak values of about 1.4 at heights of z = 2 kpc on the east side of the plane and z = 4 kpc on the west side. Beyond this height on the east side, the ratio clearly declines again, falling to about 1.0 at z = 4 kpc. Previous modeling indicates that such high values of [N II] lambda 6583/H alpha require an ionizing spectrum significantly harder than that indicated by the He I/H alpha ratio. Hence, despite the higher values of He I/H alpha , the same dilemma exists as in the Reynolds layer case. These results suggest that we do not understand the heating and ionization of the diffuse gas well enough. A determination of the gas temperature would help, but the nondetection of the line [N II] lambda 5755 allows only upper limits to be set: 13,000 K on the east side and 10,000 K on the west side. Both the [N II] and H alpha lines are detected beyond z = 5 kpc; thus, the DIG layer extends much further than indicated by previous narrowband images. A model of the electron density distribution consisting of two components with scale heights of about 1 kpc and 5--6 kpc provides a good fit to the H alpha emission profile. The very extended component was also seen in the image of Rand, Kulkarni, & Hester, but the inferred scale height is now larger. Apart from the known effects of dust absorption on the velocity centroids at low z, there is a smooth gradient in velocity centroids with increasing z above the dust lane in the sense that they become closer to the systemic velocity, changing by about 30 km s-1 from z = 1 kpc to z = 4.5 kpc. We postulate that the effect is due in part to a decreasing rotation speed and an outward radial migration of gas with z. An illustrative model suggests that the rotation speed at z = 4.5 kpc may be about 20 km s-1 slower than in the disk, although other effects could change this estimate. Such a change in rotation velocity is expected in galactic fountain models, but some simple experiments with stellar orbits show that the flow in a fountain may be more complicated than previously thought.},

	Abstract = {We review observations of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in edge-on spiral galaxies. Deep imaging has revealed a variety of morphologies for `extraplanar' (above the HII region layer) or `halo' DIG: some show widespread prominent layers of truly diffuse gas and filamentary structures, others show just one or a few patches of extraplanar emission, while still others show no detectable extraplanar DIG at all. The key galactic property which appears to govern the prominence of the DIG layer is the star formation activity. Smaller scale connections between DIG and local star formation activity can be seen in some of the galaxies. DIG halos are also related to radio continuum, X-ray and HI halos. Those galaxies with the most prominent DIG layers also have the most prominent radio halos. In NGC 891, there are spatial correlations between extraplanar DIG, radio emission, X-ray emission and HI, and these in turn are related to the underlying disk star formation activity. Progress on identifying the sources of ionization and heating of the gas has come from spectroscopy, imaging in different emission lines, and Fabry-Perot observations. By comparing with theoretical predictions, much evidence is found for photo-ionization by disk stars as the primary ionization and heating mechanism, but recent observations are beginning to point towards the need for additional sources of ionization and/or heating.},

@article{1998ApJ...501..137R,
	Abstract = {Two long-slit spectra of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in NGC 891 are presented. The first reveals variations parallel to the major axis in emission-line ratios in the halo gas at z = 700 pc. It is found that filaments of H alpha emission show lower values of [N II]/H alpha , [S II]/H alpha , and [O I]/H alpha . Although this result is expected if the filaments represent the walls of evacuated chimneys, it merely reflects a more general correlation of these ratios with H alpha surface brightness along the slit and may simply arise from radiation dilution effects. Halo regions showing low line ratios are probably relatively close to ionizing sources in the disk below. The results highlight difficulties inherent in observations of edge-on galaxies caused by lack of knowledge of structure in the in-plane directions. The [S II]/[N II] ratio shows almost no dependence on distance along the major axis or H alpha surface brightness. Values of [O I]/H alpha indicate that H is 80%-95% ionized (assuming T = 104 K), with the higher ionization fractions correlating with higher surface brightness. Much more interesting information on the nature of this gaseous halo comes from the second observation, which shows the vertical dependence of [N II]/H alpha , [S II]/H alpha , [O I]/H alpha , and [O III]/H beta through the brightest region of the DIG halo. The most surprising result, in complete contradiction to models in which the DIG is ionized by massive stars in the disk, is that [O III]/H beta rises with height above the plane for z > 1 kpc (even as [N II]/H alpha , [S II]/H alpha , and [O I]/H alpha are rising, in line with expectations from such models). The run of [S II]/[N II] is also problematic, showing essentially no contrast with z. The [O III] emission probably arises from shocks, turbulent mixing layers, or some other secondary source of ionization. Composite models in which the line emission comes from a mix of photoionized gas and shocks or turbulent mixing layers are considered in diagnostic diagrams, with the result that many aspects of the data can be explained. Problems with the run of [S II]/[N II] still remain, however. There is a reasonably large parameter space allowed for the second component. For the photoionized component, only matter-bounded models succeed, putting a fairly strong restriction on the clumpiness of the halo gas. Given the many uncertainties, the composite models can do little more than demonstrate the feasibility of these processes as secondary sources of energy input. A fairly robust result, however, is that the fraction of H alpha emission arising from the second component probably increases with z. From values of [O I]/H alpha , H is essentially 100% ionized at z = 0 kpc and 90% ionized at z = 1 kpc (again assuming T = 104 K).},

	Abstract = {We present key results from deep spectra of the diffuse ionized gas halo of the edge-on galaxy NGC 5775. [N II] lambda6583 has been detected up to z~13 kpc above the plane in one of two vertically oriented long slits-making this the spiral galaxy with the greatest spectroscopically detected halo extent in emission. Key diagnostic line ratios have been measured up to z~8 kpc, allowing the source of ionization and physical state to be probed. Ionization by a dilute radiation field from massive stars in the disk can explain some of the line ratio behavior, but departures from this picture are clearly indicated, most strongly by the rise of [O III]/Halpha with z. Velocities of the gas in both slits approach the systemic velocity of the galaxy at several kiloparsecs above the plane. We interpret this trend as a decrease in rotation velocity with z, with essentially no rotation at heights of several kiloparsecs. Such a trend was observed in the edge-on galaxy NGC 891, but here much more dramatically. This falloff is presumably due to the gravitational potential changing with z, but will also depend on the hydrodynamic nature of the disk-halo cycling of gas and projection effects. More detailed modeling of the ionization and kinematics of this and other edge-ons will be presented in future papers.},

	Abstract = {We present Very Large Array 21 cm observations of the massive edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 5746. This galaxy has recently been reported to have a luminous X-ray halo, which has been taken as evidence of residual hot gas, as predicted in galaxy formation scenarios. Such models also predict that some of this gas should undergo thermal instabilities, leading to a population of warm clouds falling onto the disk. If so, then one might expect to find a vertically extended neutral layer. We detect a substantial high-latitude component, but conclude that almost all of its mass of 1.2-1.6√{\'o}109 Msolar most likely resides in a warp. Four features far from the plane containing about 108 Msolar are found at velocities distinct from this warp. These clouds may be associated with the expected infall, although an origin in a disk-halo flow cannot be ruled out, except for one feature which is counterrotating. The warp itself may be a result of infall according to recent models. But clearly this galaxy lacks a massive, lagging neutral halo as found in NGC 891. The disk H I is concentrated into two rings of radii 1.5' and 3'. Radial inflow is found in the disk, probably due to the bar in this galaxy. A nearby member of this galaxy group, NGC 5740, is also detected. It shows a prominent one-sided extension which may be the result of ram pressure stripping.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and H2 emission in the halos of three edge-on galaxies, NGC 891, NGC 5775, and NGC 3044, based on 10-20 mum Spitzer Space Telescope spectra. The [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratio, an excellent measure of radiation hardness, rises with z in the halo of NGC 891. It is also higher in the halo of NGC 5775 than in the disk. NGC 3044 presents a more confusing situation. To explain the [Ne III]/[Ne II] as well as optical line ratio behavior in NGC 891, we carry out a simple exploration of parameter space with CLOUDY, which indicates a large increase in radiation temperature with height. Illustrative examples of physical models using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code show that the rising neon ratio may be explained by adding a vertically extended, hot stellar source to a thin disk of massive stars. However, several other sources of hard spectra may be relevant. PAH features have scale heights of 430-530 pc in NGC 891 and 720-1080 pc in NGC 5775, suggesting they can be transported by disk-halo flows. Within NGC 891 and NGC 5775, scale heights are similar for all PAHs. For NGC 891, the scale heights exceed that of 8 mum emission, indicating a transition from more ionized to more neutral PAHs with height. Most PAH equivalent widths are higher in the halos. H217.03 mum emission with scale heights of 550-580 pc in NGC 891 and 850 pc in NGC 5775 suggests a molecular component in a surprisingly thick layer.},

	Abstract = {We present infrared spectroscopy from the Spitzer Space Telescope at one disk position and two positions at a height of 1 kpc from the disk in the edge-on spiral NGC 891, with the primary goal of studying halo ionization. Our main result is that the [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratio, which provides a measure of the hardness of the ionizing spectrum free from the major problems plaguing optical line ratios, is enhanced in the extraplanar pointings relative to the disk pointing. Using a 2D Monte Carlo-based photoionization code that accounts for the effects of radiation field hardening, we find that this trend cannot be reproduced by any plausible photoionization model and that a secondary source of ionization must therefore operate in gaseous halos. We also present the first spectroscopic detections of extraplanar PAH features in an external normal galaxy. If they are in an exponential layer, very rough emission scale heights of 330-530 pc are implied for the various features. Extinction may be nonnegligible in the midplane and reduce these scale heights significantly. There is little significant variation in the relative emission from the various features between disk and extraplanar environment. Only the 17.4 mum feature is significantly enhanced in the extraplanar gas compared to the other features, possibly indicating a preference for larger PAHs in the halo.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic analysis of the Trapezium cluster stars inside the Orion nebula. The rotational velocities were obtained using the Fourier analysis method, and we found agreement with values derived by the usual method based on linewidth measurements. The rotational velocity derived for theta1 Ori C by this method is consistent with the variability of some of its spectral features that have a period of 15.42 days. By means of the fit of H, He I, and He II observed profiles with Fastwind synthetic profiles, stellar parameters and wind characteristics were derived. This methodology let us estimate the errors associated with these parameters, and we found that macroturbulence effects have to be included for a good fit to the He I-II lines in the spectrum of theta1 Ori C. By means of a very accurate study, oxygen abundances were derived for the three B0.5V stars theta1 Ori A, D, and theta2 Ori B. Final abundances are consistent with the nebular gas-phase results presented in Esteban et al. (2004) and are lower than those given by Cunha & Lambert (1994). Our results suggest a lower dust depletion factor of oxygen than previous estimations for the Orion nebula.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of the ionizing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) predicted by four modern stellar atmosphere codes, TLUSTY, CMFGEN, WM-basic and FASTWIND. We consider three sets of stellar parameters representing a late O-type dwarf (O9.5V), a mid-O-type (O7V) dwarf and an early O-type dwarf (O5.5V). We explore two different possibilities for such a comparison, following what we called evolutionary and observational approaches: in the evolutionary approach, one compares the SEDs of stars defined by the same values of Teff and logg in the observational approach, the models to be compared do not necessarily have the same Teff and logg, but produce similar H and HeI-II optical lines. We find that there is a better agreement, in terms of Q(H0), the ratio Q(He0)/Q(H0) and the shape of the SEDs predicted by the four codes in the spectral range between 13 and 30 eV, when models are compared following the observational approach. However, even in this case, large differences are found at higher energies.  We then discuss how the differences in the SEDs may affect the overall properties of surrounding nebulae in terms of temperature and ionization structure. We find that the effect over the nebular temperature is not larger than 300-350 K. Contrarily, the different SEDs produce significantly different nebular ionization structures. This will lead to important consequences on the establishment of the ionization correction factors that are used in the abundance determination of HII regions, as well as in the characterization of the ionizing stellar population from nebular line ratios.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We re-examine the recombination/collisional emission line (RL/CEL) nebular abundance discrepancy problem in the light of recent high-quality abundance determinations in young stars in the Orion star-forming region.  Methods: We re-evaluate the CEL and RL abundances of several elements in the Orion nebula and estimate the associated uncertainties, taking into account the uncertainties in the ionization correction factors for unseen ions. We estimate the amount of oxygen trapped in dust grains for several scenarios of dust formation. We compare the resulting gas+dust nebular abundances with the stellar abundances of a sample of 13 B-type stars from the Orion star-forming region (Ori OB1), analyzed in Papers I and III of this series.  Results: We find that the oxygen nebular abundance based on recombination lines agrees much better with the stellar abundances than the one derived from the collisionally excited lines. This result calls for further investigation. If the CEL/RL abundance discrepancy were caused by temperature fluctuations in the nebula, as argued by some authors, the same kind of discrepancy should be seen for the other elements, such as C, N and Ne, which is not what we find in the present study. Another problem is that with the RL abundances, the energy balance of the Orion nebula is not well understood. We make some suggestions concerning the next steps to undertake to solve this problem.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We have selected the Galactic H ii region M 43, a close-by apparently spherical nebula ionized by a single star (HD 37061, B0.5 V) to investigate several topics of recent interest in the field of H ii regions and massive stars. In a series of two papers, we perform a combined, comprehensive study of the nebula and its ionizing star by using as many observational constraints as possible.  Methods: We collected for this study a set of high-quality observations, including the optical spectrum of HD 37061, along with nebular optical imaging and long-slit spatially resolved spectroscopy. The first part of our study comprises a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the ionizing star, and the empirical analysis of the nebular images and spectroscopy. All the information obtained here will be used to construct a customised photoionization model of the nebula in Paper II.  Results: We determine the stellar parameters of HD 37061 and the total number of ionizing photons emitted by the star. We find observational evidence of scattered light from the Huygens region (the brightest part of the Orion nebula) in the M 43 region. We show the importance of an adequate correction of this scattered light in both the imagery and spectroscopic observations of M 43 in accurately determining the total nebular Halpha luminosity, the nebular physical conditions. and chemical abundances. We perform a detailed nebular empirical analysis of nine apertures extracted from a long-slit located to the west of HD 37061 (east-west direction), obtaining the spatial distribution of the physical conditions and ionic abundances. For three of the analyzed elements (O, S, and N), we determine total abundances directly from observable ions (no ionization correction factors are needed). The comparison of these abundances with those derived from the spectrum of the Orion nebula indicates the importance of the atomic data and, specially in the case of M 42, the considered ionization correction factors.  The INT and WHT telescopes are operated on the island of La Palma by the RGO in the Spanish Roque de los Muchachos Observatory of the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias.},

	Abstract = {We report on the detection of a third massive star component in the sigma Orionis AB system, traditionally considered as a binary system. The system has been monitored by the IACOB Spectroscopic Survey of Northern Massive Stars program, obtaining 23 high-resolution FIES@NOT spectra with a time span of ~2.5 years. The analysis of the radial velocity curves of the two spectroscopic components observed in the spectra has allowed us to obtain the orbital parameters of the system, resulting in a high eccentric orbit (e ~ 0.78) with an orbital period of 143.5 ¬$\pm$ 0.5 days. This result implies the actual presence of three stars in the sigma Orionis AB system when combined with previous results obtained from the study of the astrometric orbit (with an estimated period of ~157 years).  Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias.},

	Abstract = {Photoionization models of the giant HII region (GHIIR) 30 Doradus are built and confronted to available ultraviolet (UV), optical, infrared (IR) [Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)] and radio spectra, under blackbody or CoStar spectral energy distributions for the primary source and various density distributions for the nebular gas. Chemically homogeneous models show very small rms electron-temperature fluctuations and fail to reproduce the heavy-element optical recombination line (ORL) spectrum of the nebula. Dual-abundance models incorporating small-scale chemical inhomogeneities in the form of hydrogen-deficient inclusions which are in pressure balance with the normal-composition ambient gas, provide a better fit to the observed heavy-element ORLs and other nebular lines, while most spectral features are satisfactorily accounted for. The inclusions, whose mass is ~2per cent of the total gaseous mass, are 2-3 times cooler and denser than the ambient nebula. Their O/H abundance ratio is ~0.9dex larger than in the normal-composition gas and have typical mass fractions of X= 0.687, Y= 0.273 and Z= 0.040. Helium is found to be about as deficient as hydrogen in the inclusions, while elements heavier than neon, such as sulphur and argon, are quite possibly enhanced in proportions similar to oxygen, as indicated by the most satisfactory dual-abundance model obtained. This suggests that the posited hydrogen-deficient inclusions may have arisen from partial mixing of matter which was nucleosynthetically processed in a supernova event with gas of normal Large Magellanic Cloud composition. The average gaseous abundances of the chemically inhomogeneous models are ~0.08dex higher than those of the homogeneous models, yet they are lower by a similar ~0.08dex than those derived from standard empirical methods (fully corrected for inaccuracies in ionization correction factors and differences in atomic data) which postulate temperature fluctuations in a chemically homogeneous medium. Attention is drawn to a bias in the determination of HII region (HIIR) helium abundances in the presence of hydrogen-deficient inclusions. It is argued that these results provide evidence for incomplete small-scale mixing of the interstellar medium (ISM). The case for the existence of abundance inhomogeneities in HIIRs is examined in the light of current theoretical considerations regarding the process of chemical homogenization in the ISM.},

	Abstract = {Optical integral field spectroscopy of the archetype protoplanetary disc LV 2 in the Orion nebula is presented, taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) FLAMES/Argus fibre array. The detection of recombination lines (RLs) of C II and O II from this class of objects is reported, and the lines are utilized as abundance diagnostics. The study is complemented with the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph ultraviolet and optical spectra of the target contained within the Argus field of view. By subtracting the local nebula background the intrinsic spectrum of the proplyd is obtained and its elemental composition is derived for the first time. The proplyd is found to be overabundant in carbon, oxygen and neon compared to the Orion nebula and the Sun.  The simultaneous coverage over LV 2 of the C III]lambda1908 and [O III]lambda5007 collisionally excited lines (CELs) and C II and O II RLs has enabled us to measure the abundances of C2 + and O2 + for LV 2 with both sets of lines. The two methods yield consistent results for the intrinsic proplyd spectrum, but not for the proplyd spectrum contaminated by the generic nebula spectrum, thus providing one example where the long-standing abundance anomaly plaguing metallicity studies of H II regions has been resolved. These results would indicate that the standard forbidden-line methods used in the derivation of light metal abundances in H II regions in our own and other galaxies underestimate the true gas metallicity.},

	Abstract = {Integral field spectroscopy of the LV 2 proplyd is presented taken with the Very Large Telescope (VLT)/FLAMES Argus array at an angular resolution of 0.31 √{\'o} 0.31 arcsec2 and velocity resolutions down to 2 km s-1 pixel-1. Following subtraction of the local M42 emission, the spectrum of LV 2 is isolated from the surrounding nebula. We measured the heliocentric velocities and widths of a number of lines detected in the intrinsic spectrum of the proplyd, as well as in the adjacent Orion nebula falling within a 6.6 √{\'o} 4.2 arcsec2 field of view. It is found that far-ultraviolet to optical collisional lines with critical densities, Ncr, ranging from 103 to 109 cm-3 suffer collisional de-excitation near the rest velocity of the proplyd correlating tightly with their critical densities. Lines of low Ncr are suppressed the most. The bipolar jet arising from LV 2 is spectrally and spatially well detected in several emission lines. We compute the [O III] electron temperature profile across LV 2 in velocity space and measure steep temperature variations associated with the red-shifted lobe of the jet, possibly being due to a shock discontinuity. From the velocity-resolved analysis the ionized gas near the rest frame of LV 2 has Te= 9200 ¬$\pm$ 800 K and Ne{\`A}{\'u} 106 cm-3, while the red-shifted jet lobe has Te‚{\^a}{\`a} 9000-104 K and Ne{\`A}{\'u} 106-107 cm-3. The jet flow is highly ionized but contains dense semineutral clumps emitting neutral oxygen lines. The abundances of N+, O2 +, Ne2 +, Fe2 +, S+and S2 +are measured for the strong red-shifted jet lobe. Iron in the core of LV 2 is depleted by 2.54 dex with respect to solar as a result of sedimentation on dust, whereas the efficient destruction of dust grains in the fast microjet raises its Fe abundance to at least 30 per cent solar. Sulphur does not show evidence of significant depletion on dust, but its abundance both in the core and the jet is only about half solar. Based on observations made with ESO telescopes at the Paranal Observatory under programme 078.C-0247(A).},

	Abstract = {Spectrophotometric observations with the Hawaii Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (HIFI) of the Halpha and [N II] lambdalambda6548, 6584 lines has detected a diffuse ionized medium (DIM) pervading the inner {\`A}{\'u}10 kpc diameter disk of the nearby, luminous Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The physics and dynamics of this energetic gas are distinct from the population of adjacent disk H II regions which have line intensity ratios [N II] lambda6584/Halpha < 0.5, equivalent widths of Halpha 15-100 √{\"O}, and [N II] lambda6584 line widths 100 km s-1 FWHM. The DIM exhibits broader lines (150-250 km s-1 FWHM) than the H II regions which suggests an exponential scale height of at least {\`A}{\'u}400 pc, compared with {\`A}{\'u}50 pc for the cold neutral phase. The DIM is characterized by strong [N II] lambda6584 emission (3.0 √{\'o} 1041 ergs s-1) when compared to Halpha (1.2 √{\'o} 1041 ergs s-1), with [N II] lambda6584/Halpha {\`A}{\'u} 1 throughout and reaching 2-3 NE and SW along the radio axis. Because the chemical abundances throughout the inner disk are known to be approximately solar and we have corrected for Balmer absorption by the underlying stellar population, the extent of the high [N II] lambda6584/Halpha gas and, for a filling factor phi, the associated cooling time (‚{\^a}{\`a} 2 √{\'o} 105phi0.5 yr) indicate substantial excitation of the DIM. We discuss heating by the Seyfert nucleus and the extended starburst region because these regions share the bolometric luminosity.},

	Abstract = {Photoionization of the solar abundance diffuse ionized media (DIM) in NGC 1068 by anisotropic nuclear emission is studied. It is shown that the emission characteristics can be understood in the light of the developing picture of the galaxy in which its intrinsic type 1 Seyfert nucleus, concealed by an obscuring medium, is visible only through scattered, polarized light. The gas excitation is anisotropic, the high-excitation gas along the jet axis being photoionized by direct nuclear continuum, while the lower excitation gas away from the axis sees only indirect nuclear emission scattered into it. A model of low optical depth, near-nuclear Thomson scattering is considered in detail, and it is shown that, even with moderate dust extinction, this mechanism is sufficient to energize the DIM.},

	Abstract = {Additional evidence is presented for the existence of an extended (about 10 kpc; about 135 arcsec), diffuse ionized medium (DIM) recently detected in the nearby, luminous Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The DIM phase was recognized from spectrophotometric H-alpha and N II forbidden-line 6548, 6584 line emission maps obtained with the Hawaii Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer (HIFI). It is demonstrated that the H-alpha equivalent-width distribution, when combined with the N II forbidden-line 6584/H-alpha line ratio distribution, permits a clean separation of the DIM from the adjacent H II region population. The main reasons that lead to a belief that the DIM is photoexcited predominantly by scattered light from the active nucleus rather than the extended stellar population are summarized.},

	Abstract = {The photoionization of diffuse, high-latitude gas in NGC 891 by the UV radiation from various in situ stellar populations was modeled. It is found that, although OB stars dominate the production of stellar UV photons, models using only OB stars cannot reproduce the observed N II forbidden-line 6584/H-alpha ratios seen throughout this diffuse ionized medium (DIM). Models that combine OB stars with the high-temperature end of the white-dwarf distribution and the central stars of planetary nebulae are capable of reproducing the observed N II forbidden-line 6584/H-alpha ratios. Estimation of ionizing photon fluxes, using fee-free and infrared emission, combined with these models requires the filling factor throughout the DIM in NGC 891 to be of order 0.01 and that white dwarfs and planetary nebula central stars contribute about 25 percent of the ionizing photons at z = 250 pc. The model results indicate that the filling factor of the DIM in the Milky Way is approximately 0.1, in agreement with previous estimates.},

	Abstract = {We present echelle spectroscopy in the 3500- to 7060-√{\"O} range for two positions of the Orion nebula. The data were obtained using the 2.1-m telescope at Observatorio Astr√≥nmico Nacional in San Pedro M√$\,^{\circ}$rtir, Baja California. We have measured the intensities of about 220 emission lines, in particular 81 permitted lines of C+, N+, N++, 0¬∞, 0+, Ne0, Si+, Si++ and S+, some of them produced by recombination only and others mainly by fluorescence. We have determined electron temperatures, electron densities and ionic abundances using different continuum and line intensity ratios. We derived the He, C and 0 abundances from recombination lines and find that the C/H and 0/H values are very similar to those derived from B stars of the Orion association, and that these nebular values are independent of the temperature structure. We have also derived abundances from collisionally excited lines. These abundances depend on the temperature structure; accurate t2 values have been derived comparing the On recombination lines with the [O III] collision ally excited lines. The gaseous abundances of Mg, Si and Fe show significant depletions, implying that a substantial fraction of these atoms is tied up in dust grains. The derived depletions are similar to those found in warm clouds of the Galactic disc, but are not as large as those found in cold clouds. A comparison of the solar and Orion chemical abundances is made.},

	Abstract = {Recent HST observations of the Orion Nebula show the presence of compact ({\`A}{\'u}2") emission-line objects ("proplyds") with bowlike morphologies and tails pointing away from the theta1C Ori star. We model these objects as the result of the interaction between the fast wind from theta1C and slow dense winds from accretion disks around young, low-mass stars, which are photoevaporated by the ionizing radiation coming from this massive star.  We develop a fully analytic model for this two-wind interaction, which shows that depending on the value of the dimensionless parameter lambda = F0c0/nwVw2 where c0 is the sound speed of the ionized gas, F0 is the ionizing photon flux impinging on the surface of the accretion disks, and nwVw2 is the specific momentum flux of the wind from theta1C, both "choked" subsonic (low lambda) solutions and "free" supersonic (high lambda) solutions can be found. We argue that for the case of theta1C, this second supersonic regime is relevant.  For the supersonic regime, we find that both the properties of the exciting star (theta1C) and the size of the accretion disk that ejects the photoevaporated wind enter the solution only as a direct scaling of the size of the proplyd. The only physical parameter with a more complex effect on the problem is the orientation between the axis of the accretion disk and the direction to theta1C.  We finally use this analytic model to produce predicted emission measure maps (which are directly compared to the HST images of O'Dell & Wen 1994). A good qualitative agreement is found at least for some of the proplyds observed in the Orion Nebula.},

	Abstract = {Compact emission line "LV knots" discovered by Laques and Vidal (1979A&A....73...97L) in the Orion Nebula (M 42) are found to spatially coincide with some of the "proplyds" discovered by O'Dell, Wen and Hu (1993ApJ...410..696O) in their HST images. We therefore attempt to reproduce the line profiles observed for the LV knots with the photoevaporated disk/wind interaction model that has been developed by Henney et al. (1996RMxAA..32....3H) for modelling the proplyds. In particular, we present high resolution [O3] 5007√{\"O} line profiles of the knots LV 1 (OW 168-326E), LV 2 (OW 167-317), LV 3 (OW 163-317) and LV 5 (OW 158-323), and also of another faint emission line knot (OW 171-334) in the vicinity of theta^1^ Ori C. Good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the observed line profiles is found for three of the knots, in which most of the main features of the line profiles are reproduced by the model. A partial, qualitative agreement is also found for the other knots. From these results we conclude that the model of a photoevaporated disk wind interacting with the wind from theta^1^ Ori C at least partially succeeds in reproducing the line profiles of the proplyds associated with the LV knots.},

@article{1998AJ....116..322H,
	Abstract = {We investigate whether simple models of a photoevaporated flow from an externally ionized neutral clump or wind can reproduce the observed Halpha intensity profiles of the proplyds in the inner Orion Nebula. We find that models fitted to the bright ``cusp'' at the head of each proplyd successfully predict the brightness distribution of the extended diffuse ``atmosphere'' between the proplyd and the ionizing star of the nebula (theta^1 Ori C). This is strong evidence that the ``atmospheres'' are not confined but are freely expanding photoevaporated flows, with implied mass-loss rates of up to 10^-7 M_&sun; yr^-1. The only way to reconcile such high mass-loss rates with the age of the nebula, the high fraction of stars that are proplyds, and the low extinction to these stars is for the neutral reservoir to be in the form of a flattened disk. The model fits imply that the initial Mach number of the flow from the ionization front is close to unity, which is consistent with theoretical predictions that such fronts should be approximately D-critical. The dust-to-gas ratio in the flow is not tightly constrained by the models. The distribution of projected radii of sources in the inner Trapezium cluster indicates that (1) both the proplyds and the nonproplyd stars in the cluster are strongly peaked about theta^1 Ori C on a 0.02 pc scale, much smaller than has previously been suggested, and (2) the fraction of low-mass stars that are proplyds probably decreases smoothly with increasing physical distance from theta^1 Ori C. Both these statements are supported by the distribution of inclination angles of the best-fit proplyd models, which allow the three-dimensional distribution of proplyds to be constrained.},

	Abstract = {I present a comprehensive plane-parallel radiative transfer model for the scattering by dust of emission lines in a blister H II region on the surface of a molecular cloud. The effects of dust in the molecular cloud, within the H II region, and in a layer of overlying neutral material are all included. The spectral intensity and polarization profiles of the scattered lines are calculated, as well as the effective albedo of the scattering. Analytical, semianalytical and Monte Carlo numerical techniques are used, as appropriate. The model is applied in detail to observations of the [O III] lambda 5007 A line in the inner Orion Nebula. It is shown that the observations are consistent with a backscattering origin for the broad redshifted component that is seen in this line, as well as in lines of other ionized species. High-resolution spectropolarimetry of the emission line would provide a conclusive test of the scattering model. Model fits suggest that the optical depth of dust between the ionization front and the [O III] emitting region is in the range 0.5-1.0 in the visible. Foreground scattering in the neutral lid that overlies the nebula is shown to have little effect on the line profile, although it could account for some of the unexplained broadening seen in all optical lines.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of spectroscopy of four bright proplyds in the Orion Nebula obtained at a velocity resolution of 6 km s-1. After careful isolation of the proplyd spectra from the confusing nebular radiation, the emission-line profiles are compared with those predicted by realistic dynamic/photoionization models of the objects. The spectral line widths show a clear correlation with ionization potential, which is consistent with the free expansion of a transonic, ionization-stratified, photoevaporating flow. Fitting models of such a flow simultaneously to our spectra and HST emission-line imaging provides direct measurements of the proplyd size, ionized density, and outflow velocity. These measurements confirm that the ionization front in the proplyds is approximately D-critical and provide the most accurate and robust estimate to date of the proplyd mass-loss rate. Values of (0.7-1.5)x10-6 Msolar yr-1 are found for our spectroscopic sample, although extrapolating our results to a larger sample of proplyds implies that 0.4x10-6 Msolar yr-1 is more typical of the proplyds as a whole. In view of the reported limits on the masses of the circumstellar disks within the proplyds, the length of time that they can have been exposed to ionizing radiation should not greatly exceed 104 yr-a factor of 30 less than the mean age of the proplyd stars. We review the various mechanisms that have been proposed to explain this situation, and conclude that none can plausibly work unless the disk masses are revised upward by a substantial amount.},

	Abstract = {The cometary knots found in the Helix and other planetary nebulae, together with the proplyds found in the Orion nebula and other H II regions, are both examples of photoevaporation flows in which a neutral condensation is being eroded by the heating and ionizing effects of ultraviolet radiation from an external source. However, there are important differences between the cometary knots and the proplyds, both in terms of the internal structure of their neutral components, and in the structure of the ionized flow. I compare ionization-kinematic models with subarcsecond-resolution HST imaging of the Helix knots and the Orion proplyds. In the case of the Helix knots, the ionization front is found to be of a thickness comparable to the size of the knots and is clearly resolved in the HST images. In the proplyds, on the other hand the ionization front is much thinner and is not resolved. This leads to differences in the relative spatial distribution of the Halpha and [N II] 6583√{\"O} emission between the two cases.},

The excess energy radiated in the lines as a result of the fluctuations is found to scale linearly with their mean-square amplitude t2. We find that the combined mechanical luminosity of stellar winds, champagne flows and photoevaporation flows from proplyds is insufficient to account for the temperature fluctuations of typical HII regions, but that stellar winds may possibly explain the fluctuations in planetary nebulae.},

	Abstract = {Faint high-ionization arcs of emission are found to be associated with some of the proplyds in the Orion nebula. These arcs are typically offset by 0.5-4 arcsec from the proplyds, in the direction of the ionizing star ( theta1 C Ori) and have commonly been interpreted as bowshocks, resulting from the collision between the transonic photoevaporating flow from the proplyd and the highly supersonic (1000 km s-1) stellar wind from theta1 C Ori. We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the wind-wind interaction (photoevaporating flow and supersonic wind). The results of our numerical simulation with the analytical solution for the position and the shape of the thin shell formed are compared by the interaction between two winds (spherical and plane-parallel). We compare the predicted intensity maps of our simulations with observations of the proplyd 167-317.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Space Telescope Imaging Spectrometer high-resolution spectra of the Orion proplyd LV 2 in the C III doublet at 1906.68 and 1908.73 √{\"O}. New images at the 6 cm wavelength with MERLIN complement earlier HST images at a similar spatial resolution. This object is one of the closest proplyds to theta1 Ori C, the source of the photoionizing and photoevaporating radiation. Combining the spectra with the HST images and detailed theoretical models has allowed a determination of the mass-loss rate as 8.2√{\'o}10-7 Msolar yr-1 +/-10%. This rate of mass loss is used to address the conundrum of the continued existence of proplyds. Even though they should be photoevaporated in only about 105 yr, there is no evidence for their destruction. It is concluded that the only explanation is that the age of theta1 Ori C is less than 105 yr. These spectra and previously unpublished ground-based spectra in [O III] also show the presence of a monopolar microjet, redshifted by about 100 km s-1 with respect to the systemic velocity. This jet is more visible in the 6 cm MERLIN images than in HST images, and this image together with the spectra are used to determine the flow parameters for the jet. Our spectra also include the stand-off shock that lies between LV 2 and theta1 Ori C. This is the result of the high-velocity wind coming from the hot star theta1 Ori C with the low-velocity wind coming from the proplyd. As expected, this shock is at rest with respect to the two objects. Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5 26555.},

We are incorporating the necessary hydrodynamics into Cloudy, a plasma emission code that includes the physics needed to simulate the ionized, atomic, and molecular phases of the environment. The hydrodynamical flow, from the molecular cloud through the PDR into the H II region, brings advection terms into the thermal and ionization balance allowing both the H II region and PDR to be treated self-consistently. This will enable us to fully exploit the mid to far IR spectrum to understand the chemical evolution of the host system as well as star formation on many scales. Our first applications are to Orion, the best observed of these systems.},

	Abstract = {The Orion nebula proplyd 168-326 (LV 1) consists of a pair of photoevaporation flows, one from the circumstellar disk of each member of a protostellar binary system. The two flows collide at mildly supersonic velocities, producing a dense interproplyd shell bounded by two weak shocks, while further interactions occur between the individual photoevaporation flows and the stellar wind from the ionizing star theta1 Ori C . I show how observations of the interproplyd shell allow the geometry of the binary system to be usefully constrained and investigate to what extent the weak shocks may directly contribute to the observed shell emission at optical and radio wavelengths.},

@article{2002AJ....123.3329O,
	Abstract = {HST emission-line images of five of the arguably closest planetary nebulae have shown that there is a progression of characteristics of their knots. This progression begins with dark tangential structures showing no alignment with the central star and location near the main ionization front. At the end of the progression in the largest nebulae, the knots are located throughout much of the ionized zone, where they are photoionized on the side facing the central star and accompanied by long tails well aligned radially. This modification of characteristics is what would be expected if the knots were formed near or outside the main ionization front, obtaining densities high enough to lead to their being only partially ionized as they are fully illuminated by the Lyman continuum (Lyc) radiation field. Their expansion velocities must be lower than that of the main body of the nebular shell. Their forms are altered by exposure to the radiation field from the star, although it is not clear as to the relative role of radiation pressure acting on the dust component vis-√†-vis ionization shadowing. The one object that does not fit into this sequence is NGC 2392, which is the most complex nebula in our sample. In this case the inner part of the nebula is composed of a series of loops of material, some being ionization bounded, which cover only a small fraction of the area illuminated by the star. This complex structure may be what gives rise to the large variations in electron temperature inferred from low spatial resolution observations. Cometary-form knots are seen in the outer part of this object, with these objects closely resembling those found in the largest nebula in our sample, NGC 7293. Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the closest bright planetary nebulae with the Hubble Space Telescope's WFPC2 in order to characterize the dense knots already known to exist in NGC 7293. We find knots in all of the objects, arguing that knots are common, simply not always observed because of distance. The knots appear to form early in the life cycle of the nebula, probably being formed by an instability mechanism operating at the nebula's ionization front. As the front passes through the knots they are exposed to the photoionizing radiation field of the central star, causing them to be modified in their appearance. This would then explain as evolution the difference of appearance like the lacy filaments seen only in extinction in IC 4406 on the one extreme and the highly symmetric ``cometary" knots seen in NGC 7293. The intermediate form knots seen in NGC 2392, NGC 6720, and NGC 6853 would then represent intermediate phases of this evolution.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for including steady state gas flows in the plasma physics code Cloudy, which was previously restricted to modeling static configurations. The numerical algorithms are described in detail, together with an example application to plane-parallel ionization-bounded H II regions. As well as providing the foundation for future applications to more complex flows, we find the following specific results regarding the effect of advection on ionization fronts in H II regions: (1) Significant direct effects of advection on the global emission properties occur only when the ionization parameter is lower than is typical for H II regions. For higher ionization parameters, advective effects are indirect and largely confined to the immediate vicinity of the ionization front. (2) The overheating of partially ionized gas in the front is not large, even for supersonic (R-type) fronts. For subsonic (D-type) fronts we do not find the temperature spike that has been previously claimed. (3) The most significant morphological signature of advective fronts is an electron density spike that occurs at the ionization front whenever the relative velocity between the ionized gas and the front exceeds about one-half the ionized isothermal sound speed. Observational evidence for such a spike is found in [N II] lambda6584 images of the Orion bar. (4) Plane-parallel, weak-D fronts are found to show at best a shallow correlation between mean velocity and ionization potential for optical emission lines even when the flow velocity closely approaches the ionized sound speed. Steep gradients in velocity versus ionization, such as those observed in the Orion Nebula, seem to require transonic flows, which are only possible in a diverging geometry when radiation forces are included.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a combined observational and theoretical investigation of the ubiquitous knots in the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293). We have constructed a combined hydrodynamic + radiation model for the ionized portion of these knots and have accurately calculated a static model for their molecular regions. Imaging observations in optical emission lines were made with the Hubble Space Telescope's STIS, operating in a ``slitless'' mode, complemented by WFPC2 images in several of the same lines. The NICMOS camera was used to image the knots in H2. These observations, when combined with other studies of H2 and CO, provide a complete characterization of the knots. They possess dense molecular cores of densities about 106 cm-3 surrounded on the central star side by a zone of hot H2. The temperature of the H2-emitting layer defies explanation either through detailed calculations for radiative equilibrium or through simplistic calculations for shock excitation. Farther away from the core is the ionized zone, whose peculiar distribution of emission lines is explained by the expansion effects of material flowing through this region. The shadowed region behind the core is the source of most of the CO emission from the knot and is of the low temperature expected for a radiatively heated molecular region.

	Abstract = {We present hydrodynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of a cloud with large-scale density gradients, giving rise to an ionized, photoevaporation flow. The flow is found to be approximately steady during the large part of its evolution, during which it can resemble a ``champagne flow'' or a ``globule flow'' depending on the curvature of the ionization front. The distance from source to ionization front and the front curvature uniquely determine the structure of the flow, with the curvature depending on the steepness of the lateral density gradient in the neutral cloud. We compare these simulations with both new and existing observations of the Orion Nebula and find that a model with a mildly convex ionization front can reproduce the profiles of emission measure, electron density, and mean line velocity for a variety of emitting ions on scales of 1017-1018 cm. The principal failure of our model is that we cannot explain the large observed widths of the [O I] lambda6300 line that form at the ionization front.},

	Abstract = {We use new Hubble Space Telescope and archived images to clarify the nature of the ubiquitous knots in the Helix Nebula, which are variously estimated to contain a significant to majority fraction of the material ejected by its central star. We employ published far-infrared spectrophotometry and existing 2.12 mum images to establish that the population distribution of the lowest rovibrational states of H2 is close to the distribution of a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium at 988+/-119 K. In addition, we present calculations that show that the weakness of the H2 0-0 S(7) line is not a reason for making the unlikely-to-be-true assumption that H2 emission is caused by shock excitation. We derive a total flux from the nebula in H2 lines and compare this with the power available from the central star for producing this radiation. We establish that neither soft X-rays nor 912-1100 √{\"O} radiation has enough energy to power the H2 radiation-only the stellar extreme-ultraviolet radiation shortward of 912 √{\"O} does. New images of the knot 378-801 in the H2 2.12 mum line reveal that the 2.12 mum cusp lies immediately inside the ionized atomic gas zone. This property is shared by material in the ``tail'' region. The H2 2.12 mum emission of the cusp confirms previous assumptions, while the tail's property firmly establishes that the tail structure is an ionization-bounded radiation shadow behind the optically thick core of the knot. A unique new image of a transitional region of the nebula's inner disk in the He II lambda4686 line fails to show any emission from knots that might have been found in the He++ core of the nebula. We also re-examined high signal-to-noise ratio ground-based telescope images of this same inner region and found no evidence of structures that could be related to knots.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We critically examine a scenario for the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) in which supernova ejecta follow a long (108 yr) journey before falling back onto the galactic disk in the form of metal-rich ``droplets'', These droplets do not become fully mixed with the interstellar medium until they become photoionized in H ii regions. We investigate the hypothesis that the photoionization of these highly metallic droplets can explain the observed ``abundance discrepancy factors'' (ADFs), which are found when comparing abundances derived from recombination lines and from collisionally excited lines, both in Galactic and extragalactic H ii regions. We derive bounds of 1013-1015 cm on the droplet sizes inside H ii regions in order that (1) they should not have already been detected by direct imaging of nearby nebulae, and (2) they should not be too swiftly destroyed by diffusion in the ionized gas. From photoionization modelling we find that, if this inhomogeneous enrichment scenario holds, then the recombination lines strongly overestimate the metallicities of the fully mixed H ii regions. The abundances derived from collisionally excited lines also suffer some bias, although to a much lesser extent. In the absence of any recipe for correcting these biases, we recommend the discarding of all objects showing large ADFs from studies of galactic chemical evolution. These biases must also be kept in mind when comparing the galactic abundance gradients for elements derived from recombination lines with those derived from collisionally excited lines. Finally, we propose a set of observations that could be undertaken to test our scenario and improve our understanding of element mixing in the ISM.},

	Abstract = {The hydrogen ionization and dissociation front around an ultraviolet radiation source should merge when the ratio of ionizing photon flux to gas density is sufficiently low and the spectrum is sufficiently hard. This regime is particularly relevant to the molecular knots that are commonly found in evolved planetary nebulae, such as the Helix Nebula, where traditional models of photodissociation regions have proved unable to explain the high observed luminosity in H2 lines. In this paper we present results for the structure and steady state dynamics of such advection-dominated merged fronts, calculated using the Cloudy plasma/molecular physics code. We find that the principal destruction processes for H2 are photoionization by extreme ultraviolet radiation and charge-exchange reactions with protons, both of which form H+2, which rapidly combines with free electrons to undergo dissociative recombination. Advection moves the dissociation front to lower column densities than in the static case, which vastly increases the heating in the partially molecular gas due to photoionization of He0, H2, and H0. This causes a significant fraction of the incident bolometric flux to be reradiated as thermally excited infrared H2 lines, with the lower excitation pure rotational lines arising in 1000 K gas and higher excitation H2 lines arising in 2000 K gas, as is required to explain the H2 spectrum of the Helix cometary knots.

	Abstract = {We have used widely spaced in time Hubble Space Telescope images to determine tangential velocities of features associated with outflows from young stars. These observations were supplemented by ground-based telescope spectroscopy, and from the resultant radial velocities, space velocities were determined for many outflows. Numerous new moving features were found and grouped into known and newly assigned Herbig-Haro objects. It was found that stellar outflow is highly discontinuous, as frequently is the case, with long-term gaps of a few hundred years, and that these outflow periods are marked by staccato bursts over periods of about ten years. Although this has been observed in other regions, the Orion Nebula Cluster presents the richest display of this property. Most of the large-scale Herbig-Haro objects in the brightest part of the Orion Nebula appear to originate from a small region northeast of the strong Orion-S radio and infrared sources. With the possible exception of HH 203, we are not able to identify specific stellar sources, but do identify candidate sources for several other bright Herbig-Haro objects. We find that there are optical features in the BN-KL region that can be related to the known large-scale outflow that originates there. We find additional evidence for this outflow originating 500-1000 years ago.

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of the brightest part of the Orion Nebula is assessed in the light of published and newly established data. We find that the widely accepted model of a concave blister of ionized material needs to be altered in the southwest direction from the Trapezium, where we find that the Orion-S feature is a separate cloud of very optically thick molecules within the body of ionized gas, which is probably the location of the multiple embedded sources that produce the optical and molecular outflows that define the Orion-S star formation region. Evidence for this cloud comes from the presence of H2CO lines in absorption in the radio continuum and discrepancies in the extinction derived from radio-optical and optical-only emission. We present an equilibrium Cloudy model of the Orion-S Cloud, which successfully reproduces many observed properties of this feature, including the presence of gas-phase H2CO in absorption. We also report the discovery of an open-sided shell of [O III] surrounding the Trapezium stars, revealed through emission-line ratio images and the onset of radiation shadows beyond some proplyds. We show that the observed properties of the shell are consistent with it being a stationary structure, produced by shock interactions between the ambient nebular gas and the high-velocity wind from theta1 Ori C. We examine the implications of the recently published evidence for a large blueshifted velocity of theta1 Ori C with respect to the Orion molecular cloud, which could mean that this star has only recently begun to photoionize the Orion Nebula. We show that current observations of the nebula do not rule out such a possibility, so long as the ionization front has propagated into a pre-existing low-density region. In addition, a young age for the nebula would help explain the presence of nearby proplyds with a short mass-loss timescale to photoablation.

	Abstract = {We present the results of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the formation and expansion of H II regions and their surrounding photodissociation regions (PDRs) in turbulent, magnetized, molecular clouds on scales of up to 4 pc. We include the effects of ionizing and non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation and X-rays from population synthesis models of young star clusters. For all our simulations we find that the H II region expansion reduces the disordered component of the magnetic field, imposing a large-scale order on the field around its border, with the field in the neutral gas tending to lie along the ionization front, while the field in the ionized gas tends to be perpendicular to the front. The highest pressure-compressed neutral and molecular gas is driven towards approximate equipartition between thermal, magnetic and turbulent energy densities, whereas lower pressure neutral/molecular gas bifurcates into, on the one hand, quiescent, magnetically dominated regions and, on the other hand, turbulent, demagnetized regions. The ionized gas shows approximate equipartition between thermal and turbulent energy densities, but with magnetic energy densities that are 1-3 orders of magnitude lower. A high velocity dispersion ({\`A}{\'u}8 km s-1) is maintained in the ionized gas throughout our simulations, despite the mean expansion velocity being significantly lower. The magnetic field does not significantly brake the large-scale H II region expansion on the length and time-scales accessible to our simulations, but it does tend to suppress the smallest scale fragmentation and radiation-driven implosion of neutral/molecular gas that forms globules and pillars at the edge of the H II region. However, the relative luminosity of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation has a much larger influence than the presence or absence of the magnetic field. When the star cluster radiation field is relatively soft (as in the case of a lower mass cluster, containing an earliest spectral type of B0.5), then fragmentation is less vigorous and a thick, relatively smooth PDR forms.},

	Abstract = {In planetary nebulae (PNe), abundances of oxygen and other heavy elements derived from optical recombination lines are systematically higher than those derived from collisionally excited lines. We investigate the hypothesis that the destruction of solid bodies may produce pockets of cool, high-metallicity gas that could explain these abundance discrepancies. Under the assumption of maximally efficient radiative ablation, we derive two fundamental constraints that the solid bodies must satisfy in order that their evaporation during the PN phase should generate a high enough gas-phase metallicity. A local constraint implies that the bodies must be larger than tens of meters, while a global constraint implies that the total mass of the solid body reservoir must exceed a few hundredths of a solar mass. This mass greatly exceeds the mass of any population of comets or large debris particles expected to be found orbiting evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars. We therefore conclude that contemporaneous solid body destruction cannot explain the observed abundance discrepancies in PNe. However, similar arguments applied to the sublimation of solid bodies during the preceding asymptotic giant branch phase do not lead to such a clear-cut conclusion. In this case, the required reservoir of volatile solids is only one ten-thousandth of a solar mass, which is comparable to the most massive debris disks observed around solar-type stars, implying that this mechanism may contribute to abundance discrepancies in at least some PNe, so long as mixing of the high-metallicity gas is inefficient.},

	Abstract = {The optical [N I] doublet near 5200 √{\"O} is anomalously strong in a variety of emission-line objects. We compute a detailed photoionization model and use it to show that pumping by far-ultraviolet (FUV) stellar radiation previously posited as a general explanation applies to the Orion Nebula (M42) and its companion M43; but, it is unlikely to explain planetary nebulae and supernova remnants. Our models establish that the observed nearly constant equivalent width of [N I] with respect to the dust-scattered stellar continuum depends primarily on three factors: the FUV to visual-band flux ratio of the stellar population, the optical properties of the dust, and the line broadening where the pumping occurs. In contrast, the intensity ratio [N I]/Hbeta depends primarily on the FUV to extreme-ultraviolet ratio, which varies strongly with the spectral type of the exciting star. This is consistent with the observed difference of a factor of five between M42 and M43, which are excited by an O7 and B0.5 star, respectively. We derive a non-thermal broadening of order 5 km s-1 for the [N I] pumping zone and show that the broadening mechanism must be different from the large-scale turbulent motions that have been suggested to explain the line widths in this H II region. A mechanism is required that operates at scales of a few astronomical units, which may be driven by thermal instabilities of neutral gas in the range 1000-3000 K. In an Appendix A, we describe how collisional and radiative processes are treated in the detailed model N I atom now included in the CLOUDY plasma code.},

	Abstract = {Deep groundbased spectra of Hubble V and Hubble X, the two largest and ightest H ii regions in the Local Group dwarf galaxy, NGC 6822, are presented. The extinction, excitation and ionization are studied on scales as small as 4 pc. The chemical composition of some elements within the regions as well as possible small scale variations in the abundances of helium, nitrogen, oxygen and neon over the face of the two regions are investigated. The detection of the emission lines lbrack OIrbrack and lbrack ClIIIrbrack are probably related to shock-heating from gas ejected from supernova explosions and planetary nebula ejections, respectively, although the contribution to the total ionization is very small. No significant differences in chemical composition was found between Hubble V and Hubble X. However, some small scale variations in the abundances of oxygen, and possibly nitrogen and helium, over the face of both H ii regions were noted, although different physical conditions could apply within the regions, such as local fluctuations in the temperature.

	Abstract = {The nature of a possible correlation between metallicity and luminosity for dwarf irregular galaxies, including those with the highest luminosities, has been explored using simple chemical evolutionary models. Our models depend on a set of free parameters in order to include infall and outflows of gas and covering a broad variety of physical situations. Given a fixed set of parameters, a non-linear correlation between the oxygen abundance and the luminosity may be established. This would be the case if an effective self-regulating mechanism between the accretion of mass and the wind energized by the star formation could lead to the same parameters for all the dwarf irregular galaxies. In the case that these parameters were distributed in a random manner from galaxy to galaxy, a significant scatter in the metallicity-luminosity diagram is expected. Comparing with observations, we show that only variations of the stellar mass-to-light ratio are sufficient to explain the observed scattering and, therefore, the action of a mechanism of self-regulation cannot be ruled out. The possible origin of discrepancies in the metallicity-luminosity correlation found by different authors is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Gas-rich dwarf galaxies are probably the best objects to study signatures of a process of self-regulation between the disk and the halo. A qualitative picture about the process of self-regulation follows: in galactic gas halos with a short cooling time, halo clouds will infall ballistically if they are not destroyed by ram pressure due to the interaction with the wind. This fresh gas will activate star formation and the wind until ram pressure is able to reduce the accretion rate, resulting in a self-regulation mechanism. If this process is at work then the b-parameter defined as b  equiv A/(A - W), with A the mass accretion rate and W the rate of mass lost in the wind, should be very constant with time. Here our objective is to check whether simple chemical models that include infall of cooling gas and outflow of hot gas with constant b can explain the variations in metallicity of dwarf galaxies. In particular, we aim to discern whether the b-parameter could be similar for different types of dwarf galaxies, or i.e. on the contrary, each type requires a different A/W-ratio. In order to study the self-regulation conditions, the relationship between the metallicity (Z) and the luminosity (L) is used.},

	Abstract = {The investigation presented here was focused on clarifying the existence of dwarf spiral galaxies as a separate group from classical spirals. First, a list of spiral galaxies with small sizes was obtained. Information on colors, luminosities, morphologies and chemical content was searched for in the literature for these galaxies. Using this information, it can be concluded that dwarf spirals are not likely to be the tail of the distribution of classical galaxies. On the contrary, significant differences in some of the most important properties of spiral galaxies, such as the metallicity gradient and the bar frecuency, were found. In any case, further and more accurate observations are needed for a definitive answer.},

	Abstract = {A study of the precision of the semiempirical methods used in the determination of the chemical abundances in gas-rich galaxies is carried out. In order to do this, the oxygen abundances of a total of 438 galaxies were determined using the electronic temperature, the R 23, and the P methods. The new calibration of the P method gives the smaller dispersion for the low- and high-metallicity regions, while the best numbers in the turnaround region are given by the R 23 method. We also found that the dispersion correlates with the metallicity. Finally, it can be said that all of the semiempirical methods studied here are quite insensitive to metallicity with a value of 8.0 ¬$\pm$ 0.2 dex for more than 50% of the total sample.},

	Abstract = {It is generally believed that O stars, confined near the galactic midplane, are somehow able to photoionize a significant fraction of what is termed the "diffuse ionized gas" (DIG) of spiral galaxies, which can extend up to 1-2 kpc above the galactic midplane. The heating of the DIG remains poorly understood, however, as simple photoionization models do not reproduce the observed line ratio correlations well or the DIG temperature. We present turbulent mixing layer (TML) models in which warm photoionized condensations are immersed in a hot supersonic wind. Turbulent dissipation and mixing generate an intermediate region where the gas is accelerated, heated, and mixed. The emission spectrum of such layers is compared with observations of Rand of the DIG in the edge-on spiral NGC 891. We generate two sequence of models that fit the line ratio correlations between [S II]/Halpha, [O I]/Halpha, [N II]/[S II], and [O III]/Hbeta reasonably well. In one sequence of models, the hot wind velocity increases, while in the other, the ionization parameter and layer opacity increase. Despite the success of the mixing layer models, the overall efficiency in reprocessing the stellar UV is much too low, much less than 1%, which compels us to reject the TML model in its present form.},

	Abstract = {Studies of the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) have progressed without providing so far any strict criterion to distinguish DIGs from H II regions. In this work, we compile the emission line measurements of 29 galaxies that are available in the scientific literature, thereby setting up the first DIG database (DIGEDA). Making use of this database, we proceed to analyze the global properties of the DIG using the [NII]lambda6583/Halpha, [O I]lambda6300/Halpha, [O III]lambda5007/Hbeta and [SII]lambda6716/Halpha lines ratios, including the H alpha emission measure. This analysis leads us to conclude that the [N II]/Halpha ratio provides an objective criterion for distinguishing whether an emission region is a DIG or an H II region, while the EM(Halpha) is a useful quantity only when the galaxies are considered individually. Finally, we find that the emission regions of Irr galaxies classified as DIG in the literature appear in fact to be much more similar to H II regions than to the DIGs of spiral galaxies.},
