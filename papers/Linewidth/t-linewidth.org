+ [-] Calculate T from velocity moments
  + [X] Do maps - [[file:~/Work/Nahiely/proplyd-cloudy/emission/linewidth-T.py][linewidth-T.py]]
  + [ ] Do for general aperture
  + [ ] Run for many models
    + [ ] different inclinations
    + [ ] different metallicities
+ [ ] Calculate "real" mean T map
  + [ ] Weighted by Ha emission
  + [ ] Compare with empirically derived T 
+ [ ] More realistic fake observations
  + [ ] Add a constant nebular background
  + [ ] Convolve with PSF and/or seeing
  + [ ] Add noise
  + [ ] Add a real nebular background
    + [ ] Superimose the proplyd on a random bit of nebula
    + [ ] Extinction of the nebula by the proplyd
    + [ ] Try to interpolate and remove the nebula
