* Proplyd line ratios from WFPC2 images

** Flux callibration

+ Normalization is described in [[file:README.bob][README.bob]]
: The normalization is to the exposure times in the program GO 5085, i.e.
: f656n(200S), f658n(500s), f502n(200s), f547m(50s).

+ Calibration coefficients are from O'Dell & Doi 1999
  + copied from [[file:~/Dropbox/Org/llobjects.org::*Constants%20from%20O'Dell%20and%20Doi][llobjects.org]]


*** Equations

*** Leading coefficients

+ These are for WFC, so we need to correct for the different pixel sizes.
+ Correction factor is (0.0455/0.0996)**2 = 0.2087
