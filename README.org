* Cloudy models of proplyds

Programs to support work with Nahiely

** =src/cloudy=

*** =dense_phabden.cpp=

Implements the proplyd density profile.

** =src/parse-cloudy-output=

Routines for parsing Cloudy output. 

*** The assumptions

1. Cloudy input files are in a subdir =in/=, with name =PREFIX.in=
2. All Cloudy output files are in a subdir =out/=, with names =PREFIX.SUFFIX=, where =PREFIX= is the same as in 1. 
3. Standard output of Cloudy run was redirected to =out/PREFIX.out=
4. Using a version of cloudy where the =.em= header formatting bugs have been fixed

*** The code
